            "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.\nFor the turkey and stuffing, put the turkey crown on a lightly oiled baking tray and pat dry with kitchen paper. Season with lots of coarsely ground black pepper. Cover the breast with bacon rashers, then cover the turkey with lightly oiled foil and roast for 1 hour.\nWhile the turkey is roasting, prepare the stuffing. Melt the butter in a large non-stick frying pan. Thinly slice the leeks. Add to the pan and cook over a low heat for 3\u20134 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly.\nTip the leeks into a large, shallow ovenproof dish \u2013 a lasagne dish would work well. Tear the bread into small cubes and don\u2019t worry about the crusts, just add those too. Tip the nuts and fruit onto a board and cut any large nuts in half or quarters, then add to the bread and leeks. Add roughly three-quarters of the thyme to the stuffing mixture and sprinkle the lemon zest on top. Add the sausagemeat and season with a little salt and lots of black pepper. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly with your hands, leaving it fairly chunky. Spread loosely over the dish and set aside.\nWhen the turkey has been cooking for 1 hour, take out of the oven and reduce the temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 7. Take the turkey crown carefully off the tray and place directly on top of the stuffing. Place in the oven and roast the turkey and stuffing for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for a further 15 minutes, or until the turkey is fully cooked and the juices run clear when the thickest part is pierced with a skewer.\nMeanwhile, for the roast potatoes, put the potatoes in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole and cover with cold water. Place over a high heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 3 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a large colander and return to the saucepan. Shake vigorously to knock the potatoes about and scuff up the surface \u2013 this will make them much crisper when they roast.\nPour the oil over and toss together well. Scatter in a single layer onto a baking tray and roast for an hour, or until the potatoes are golden, crisp and tender in the centre.\nMeanwhile, for the pigs in blankets, tuck a small sprig of rosemary under the bacon on each sausage. Place on a lightly oiled baking tray with the potatoes and drizzle with the honey. Roast for 15\u201320 minutes, or until lightly browned and cooked through.\nRemove the turkey from the oven, cover loosely with kitchen foil and a couple of dry tea towels and leave to rest for 15 minutes.\nFor the bread sauce (if making), put the bread sauce mix in a non-stick saucepan and stir in roughly a quarter of the milk. Mix until well combined, then add the remaining milk and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes, stirring regularly, until thick and smooth, then add the cream and butter and cook for 1\u20132 minutes more. Pour into a warmed dish, sprinkle with a little nutmeg, and keep warm until ready to serve.\nFor the carrots, put the carrots in a microwave-proof serving dish and pour over the orange juice, dot with butter, sprinkle with parsley, add sugar and season with a little salt and lots of black pepper. Cover with cling film or a plate and cook on HIGH for 8 minutes, or until just tender, stirring halfway through cooking.\nFor the sprouts, put the butter, bacon, sprouts and chestnuts in a large non-stick saucepan or saut\u00e9 pan and season well with black pepper. Add 200ml/7fl oz cold water and bring to the boil. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring regularly until the sprouts are tender and the liquid has evaporated.\nMeanwhile, for the gravy, put the gravy, bacon, port, cranberry sauce and dried sage, if using, in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and cook gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with black pepper and a little salt, if needed. Keep warm until ready to serve.\nTo serve, warm your serving plates. Strain the gravy into warmed gravy boats and put on the table along with the roast potatoes, pigs in blankets, carrots and bread sauce (if making). Sprinkle the turkey with the remaining thyme and serve in the roasting dish along with the stuffing. Carve at the table.",

            "ingredients": [
                "200g/7oz unsalted soft butter",
                "200g/7oz caster sugar",
                "1 tsp vanilla essence",
                "1 free-range egg, lightly beaten",
                "400g/14oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting",
                "1 free-range egg white",
                "250g/9oz icing sugar",
                "food colouring, if using",
                "ready-to-roll icing, in colours of your choice, to decorate the biscuits"
            ],
            "instructions": "To make the basic dough, line a baking tray with baking parchment (you may need two baking trays or, alternatively, cook the biscuits in batches).\nIn a bowl, use a wooden spoon or a mixer to cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla essence until just creamy. Do not over work the batter at this stage. Beat in the egg until well combined.\nAdd the flour and mix on a low speed until a dough forms. In the bowl, use your hands to lightly knead the dough into a ball. Wrap it in cling film and refrigerate for least an hour.\nRoll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a depth of about 5mm, if possible use spacers to achieve an even thickness. Cut the desired shapes. For the duck biscuits: use a duck-shaped cutter and a round cutter for the base (the base should be approximately the same size as the duck). For the tree biscuits: cut two simple tree shapes out using either a cutter or a template and cut one tree shape in half vertically. For the ladybird biscuits: cut out two rounds, one slightly smaller than the other (approx. 5cm/2in and 3cm/1\u00bcin). For the lamb biscuits: use a cutter or a template to cut out two lamb shapes for each finished biscuit and cut two additional leg shapes separately (for each finished lamb biscuit you should have two lamb shapes and two leg shapes). For the sitting down person biscuits: cut a gingerbread person out of the dough and then cut off the legs. Trim about 2mm from around the edges of the legs and cut two slots out of the bottom of the gingerbread body, about the depth of the legs (the legs will slot in here once baked). Also cut out two small ovals for feet.\nTransfer the shapes onto the baking sheet using a palate knife and chill again for about 30 minutes. (This is important to prevent the biscuits losing their shape when baked.)\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\nBake the biscuits for 6\u201310 minutes, depending on size, until lightly golden-brown at the edges. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nFor the icing, lightly beat the egg white in a large bowl. Add the icing sugar and mix slowly at first to avoid an icing sugar cloud. Once combined, whisk or beat for about five minutes if using an electric beater or whisk, or for longer if using a wooden spoon. Continue whisking until the ingredients form a thick, smooth paste that is bright white in colour. If you are using colours, separate the icing into various bowls and colour accordingly.\nTo decorate the duck biscuits, thinly roll out the yellow ready-to-roll icing and cover the duck shapes. Pipe on any decoration desired for the eyes, beaks and wings. Position a wire rack over a container that will hold it at a suitable height to lean the stand up biscuit against. Use the flooding technique to ice the biscuit circles (see step 10 for more information) to represent a pond. While the icing is still wet, place the round biscuit under the edge of the wire rack. Stand the duck biscuit in position on the wet icing on the round, using the rack as support to keep it upright. Allow the icing to set completely before carefully removing the support rack.\nTo flood ice the biscuits, pipe an outline around the edge of the biscuit using either a fine nozzle or by snipping the very end off a disposable piping bag. Let the icing set for a few minutes. For flooding the icing needs to be slightly runnier, so add a few drops of water. Pipe or spoon enough of the runnier icing into the centre of the iced shape to completely fill it \u2013 don\u2019t worry about it being neat at this point. Use a toothpick to spread the icing evenly inside the hard icing \u2018wall\u2019. If the surface of the icing isn\u2019t flat, gently shake the biscuit back and forth until you have a smooth covering.\nTo decorate the tree biscuits, pipe a line of green icing all around the edge and cover the biscuits using the flooding method described in step 10. Once the icing is completely dry, use some leftover icing to pipe a zig zag along the bare edge of each half tree and attach them to the middle of the whole trees Repeat at the back of the biscuit with the remaining tree halves. You may have to hold the half trees in place while the icing sets.\nTo decorate the ladybird biscuits, brush the rounds with cooled boiled water and cover the larger round with a circle of pink or red ready-to-roll icing and the smaller in white ready-to-roll icing. Attach the white round to the base using a small ball of ready-to-roll icing and tilt on an angle. Finish decorating the ladybird by piping on a face and spots in black icing.\nTo decorate the lamb biscuits, ice half the bodies of the lambs using the flooding technique in step 10 - keeping the legs free of icing. Once the icing is dry, spread an undecorated lamb biscuit with icing and sandwich to the back of the decorated biscuit. Dot some icing on the back of the individual lamb legs and stick over the whole lamb\u2019s legs to give a 3D effect. When the icing is dry the biscuits should stand up without support. If desired, decorate the lamb\u2019s legs with icing.\nTo decorate the sitting down person biscuits, decorate the biscuit bodies as desired. Slot the legs sideways into the precut slots so the person is sitting down with their legs stretched out in front of them. Attach the feet to the bottom of the legs using icing and leave to dry.",

Now all you do is simply add all the other cake ingredients (except the icing sugar) to the bowl and, provided the butter is really soft, just go in with an electric hand whisk and whisk everything together until you have a smooth, well-combined mixture, which will take about one minute. If you do not have an electric hand whisk, you can use a wooden spoon, using a little bit more effort. What you will now end up with is a mixture that drops off a spoon when you give it a tap on the side of the bowl. If it seems a little too stiff, add a little water and mix again.\nNow divide the mixture between the two tins, level it out and place the tins on the centre shelf of the oven. The cakes will take 30-35 minutes to cook, but do not open the oven door until 30 minutes have elapsed.\nTo test whether the cakes are cooked or not, touch the centre of each lightly with a finger: if it leaves no impression and the sponges spring back, they are ready.\nNext, remove them from the oven, then wait about five minutes before turning them out on to a wire cooling rack. Carefully peel off the base papers, which is easier if you make a fold in the paper first, then pull it gently away without trying to lift it off. Now leave the sponges to get completely cold, then add the filling.\nTo make this, first slice the passion fruit into halves and, using a tsp, scoop all the flesh, juice and seeds into a bowl.\nNext, in another bowl, combine the mascarpone, fromage frais, sugar and vanilla extract, using a balloon whisk, which is the quickest way to blend them all together. After that, fold in about two-thirds of the passion fruit.\nNow place the first sponge cake on the plate or cake stand you are going to serve it on, then spread half the filling over it, drizzle the rest of the passion fruit over that, then spread the remaining filling over the passion fruit. Lastly, place the other cake on top, press it gently so that the filling oozes out at the edges, then dust the surface with a little sifted icing sugar.",

Chop the cooked bacon and the spinach. Add to the eggs along with the cooked mushrooms. Season the eggs with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nWhen the tomatoes and potatoes are golden-brown in places, spoon them into the eggs with the other vegetables. Give the egg mixture a brief stir, then pour it back into the frying pan and place it back over the heat. Cook gently over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until the egg looks set around the edges (it may be a little runny on the top).\nPlace the pan under the grill for 2 minutes to finish cooking the frittata on top.

Roll up and secure with kitchen string.\nAt this point weigh the turkey piece to calculate the cooking time: allow 20 minutes per 500g/1lb 2oz, plus an additional 20 minutes at the end.\nFor the basting liquid, melt the butter, add the cider and heat through. Season with salt and pepper.\nPlace the turkey in a roasting tray and baste well before transferring to the oven. Continue to baste from time to time, but cover with kitchen foil if it\u2019s browning too much. Roast for the calculated time, or until the juices in the thickest part of the breast run clear (if using a meat thermometer, the stuffed turkey should reach a core temperature of 72C). Transfer the turkey to a plate and cover to keep warm while you let it rest. Retain the tray with the cooking juices.\nFor the gravy, make a roux by melting the butter in a saucepan, adding the flour and cooking until the mixture whitens a little.\nPlace the turkey roasting tray over the heat, add the shallots and cook over a medium heat until soft (about 3 minutes). Add the sage and the brandy (or calvados) and simmer to burn off the alcohol.\nPour in the chicken stock, return to a boil, and cook until the volume of liquid reduces a little. Add some of the roux to thicken the sauce. Pour in the cream and allow to simmer for a minute.\nTo garnish, add the butter to a frying pan set over a medium heat and allow to melt. Place the apples in the pan cut-side down. Sprinkle over the sugar and sage and fry until glazed.\nRemove the string from the turkey and serve it in slices with the cider gravy and glazed apples.

Add a large spoonful of the egg whites and fold in using a large metal spoon. Stir in the rest of the egg whites, trying to preserve as much of the air in the whites as possible. You should have a fluffy, bubbly batter.\nHeat a frying pan (preferably around 20cm/8in) to a medium heat and rub over a little butter. Pour 1\u00bd ladlefuls of the batter into the frying pan \u2013 it should spread out to around 20cm/8in in diameter. Take a couple of tablespoons of the sausage mixture and sprinkle over the pancake. The pancake will rise up around the sausage meat as it cooks. When the pancake has browned on the bottom and is firm enough to flip, turn it over quickly and cook for another minute on the other side. Repeat with the rest of the batter and the sausage meat.

            "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1.\nFirst take a large frying pan, the largest you have, heat 3 tbsp of the oil and gently fry the onion and garlic over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, moving it around from time to time.\nWhile the onion is softening, chop the pancetta: the best way to do this after opening the pack is to roll the contents into a sausage shape, then using a sharp knife slice it lengthways into four, then slice the lengths across as finely as possible. After 10 minutes, add this to the pan to join the onions and garlic and continue cooking them all for another 5 minutes.\nNow transfer this mixture to the casserole. Add another tbsp of oil to the pan, turn the heat up to its highest then add the minced beef and brown it, breaking it up and moving it round in the pan. When the beef is browned tip it into the casserole. Heat another tbsp of the oil and do exactly the same with the minced pork. While the pork is browning, trim the chicken livers, rinse them under cold running water, dry them thoroughly with kitchen paper and chop them minutely small. When the pork is browned, transfer it to the casserole, then heat the remaining tbsp of oil and brown the pieces of chicken liver. Add these to the casserole.\nNow you've finished with the frying pan, so get rid of that and place the casserole over the direct heat, give everything a good stir together, then add the contents of the tins of tomatoes, the tomato pur\u00e9e, red wine and a really good seasoning of salt, pepper and nutmeg.\nAllow this to come up to simmering point. Then strip the leaves from half the basil, chop them very finely and add them to the pot. As soon as everything is simmering, place the casserole on the centre shelf of the oven and leave it to cook slowly, without a lid, for 4 hours. It's a good idea to have a look after 3 hours to make sure all is well, but what you should end up with is a thick, concentrated sauce with only a trace of liquid left in it, then remove it from the oven, taste to check the seasoning, strip the leaves off the remainng basil, chop them small and stir them in.\nThen when the sauce is absolutely cold, divide it, using scales, by spooning 225g/8oz into polythene freezer bags. Seal them leaving a little bit of air at the top to allow room for expansion. Each 225g/8oz pack, thoroughly defrosted and re-heated, will provide enough rag\u00f9 for 225g/8oz pasta, which will serve 2 people.",

Add the green vegetables and cook gently for 7\u201310 minutes, stirring frequently.\nAdd the leafy greens, starting with the toughest (i.e. kale, cabbage, spring greens). You may need to add them a handful at a time to fit in your pan, but they will wilt down quickly. Tougher greens will need to cook for around 15 minutes until tender, but baby spinach, rocket and salad leaves will wilt in about 5 minutes. When everything is tender, but still bright, set aside until cool enough to handle.\nSqueeze the greens in a sieve to get rid of any liquid. Add to a large bowl and mix in the herbs, cheese and lemon zest. When everything is combined, season to taste, then stir in the eggs.\nPreheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.\nBrush the bottom of a 9in/23cm square baking dish with some of the remaining olive oil. Take the filo pastry from the packet and keep under a damp tea towel so it doesn\u2019t dry out and become brittle.\nWorking with one sheet at a time, brush the filo all over with a light coating of olive oil. Lay one sheet in the baking dish, pushing it gently into the corners and leaving the excess filo overhanging. Then lay the second oiled sheet in perpendicular to the first. Lay a third sheet in the dish, crossing the second. Now fill this base with the vegetables and wrap the overhanging ends over the top.\nBrush the remaining filo sheets with oil, scrunch each sheet up loosely and place on top of the pie so it is completely covered.\nBake in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp and the filling is piping hot all the way through.\nCut into squares and serve with a fresh tomato salad and some crusty bread.",

Line with cling film and fill with baking beans or rice (NB: Not every type of cling film is suitable for using with all foods. Check the description on the packaging to see what foods and what temperatures it can be used with. If unsure, use tin foil or baking paper instead). Place in the fridge for an hour to rest again.\nBake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, then remove the baking beans and cling film and bake for another 5-10 minutes, or until cooked all the way through and a light golden-brown colour. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.\nFor the filling, place the butter, sugar and orange zest in a pan. Heat until the butter and sugar are melted.\nAdd the bramley apples and the cinnamon and cook until the apple is very soft and turning into a pur\u00e9e. Add the eating apples and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, then remove from the heat.\nPour the mixture into a colander or sieve to remove any excess liquid. Discard the cinnamon stick and leave the apples to cool.\nFor the crumble topping, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\nMix the plain flour, caster sugar, ground almonds, flakes almonds and butter together with your hands, using your fingertips to rub the dry ingredients into the butter.\nPlace this mixture on a baking tray and bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until golden-brown and crumbly. Stir the crumble every five minutes so that it cooks evenly. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.\nTo assemble the pie, spoon the apple mixture into the cooked pastry case.

Completely cover the apple mixture with the toasted crumble and the dot a few more pieces of toffee on top.\nBake in the oven at 180C/350F/Gas 4 for 10-12 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the toffee has melted.\nServe with custard, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, ice cream or clotted cream\u2026.or all four!",

Brush the edges of the pastry in the tin with milk then put the pastry lid on top. Seal the edges with your fingertips and trim off the excess pastry neatly. Brush the pastry with milk and sprinkle over a little sugar. Make two slits in the top to allow steam to escape.\nBake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden-brown. Leave for at least 15 minutes before slicing. The pie is delicious hot or cold and needs no accompaniment.",

Set the remaining bread aside. Transfer the mould to the fridge while you make the filling.\nTo make the filling, heat the sugar in a large saut\u00e9 pan over a medium heat until it reaches a dark caramel colour. Tip in the butter and let the mixture bubble for a few seconds. Add the apples, toss to coat in the caramel, then cook over a high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nPour the apple filling into the lined mould, then top with enough pieces of bread to seal. Clip the lid on firmly, or if you\u2019re using a pudding basin, cover with foil and rest a heavy baking tray on top. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a warm serving plate.\nMeanwhile, to make the custard, combine the milk, vanilla pod and seeds in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a large, heatproof bowl.\nPour the milk through a sieve onto the egg yolk mixture, whisking as you pour to combine. Return the mixture to the pan over a low heat and cook gently for 2\u20133 minutes, stirring constantly, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. As soon as the custard is cooked, pour into a serving jug. Serve alongside the apple Charlotte. See recipe tips below.",

Set aside to cool in the tin.\nFor the praline, fill a large bowl with cold water. In a heavy-based pan melt the sugar to a golden-brown caramel, swirling the pan occasionally so it doesn\u2019t burn and using a damp pastry brush to brush down any sugar crystals from around the edge of the pan.

When completely set, blend in a food processor to make a praline.\nWhen the cake is cool, prick with a cocktail stick and spoon over the Calvados.

Dust with a little flour and knead for 5 minutes, then shape into a ball.\nLightly oil a mixing bowl and a large piece of cling film. Put the dough in the bowl and cover with the cling film. Set aside in a warm place to prove for an hour, or until almost doubled in size.\nFor the filling, beat the butter and 110g/4oz of the sugar in a mixing bowl. Stir in the cinnamon and set aside.\nPut the apples in a saucepan and add the remaining sugar. Cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly, until the apples begin to break down. Add the sultanas, orange juice, orange zest, and lemon zest. Heat gently for 5 minutes then set aside to cool. When cold, stir in the vanilla extract.\nFor the glaze, combine the apricot conserve and lemon juice with 2 tablespoons water in a heavy-based saucepan. Slowly bring to the boil, (don\u2019t stir it too much or bubbles will form and the glaze will appear cloudy), transfer the glaze to a heatproof bowl and place over a pan of gently simmering water until the glaze is runny. Pass through a sieve then return to the pan and set aside.\nTo finish the pastry, roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until 1cm/\u00bdin thick.\nBeat the chilled butter using a rolling pin, until it is flattened into a rectangle roughly half the size of the dough rectangle. Arrange the dough with a short edge nearest you and put the butter in the middle. Fold the top and bottom of the pastry over the butter and press down the edges to ensure the butter is sealed within the pastry. Using a rolling pin, tap the dough from the middle upwards and from the middle downwards. This ensures that the butter is evenly distributed.\nRoll out the pastry to a large rectangle approximately 1cm/\u00bdin thick. Turn dough so you have a long edge nearest you, then fold the right third into the middle and cover with the left third. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Do this turning, folding and chilling two more times.\nPreheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line two large baking trays with non-stick baking paper.\nTo assemble the pastries, roll the pastry out into a rectangle about 36x30cm/10x8in and 1cm/\u00bdin thick. Spread with the cinnamon and butter mixture leaving about 2cm/\u00bein of dough free from the mixture on the side nearest to you. Roll up the dough towards you. Brush the last bit of dough with a little egg wash to help it stick.\nCut away the scruffy ends then slice the roll into 12 even pieces with a sharp knife. Place the pastries on the prepared trays, allowing plenty of room around each one. Lightly flour your hands and flatten each slice slightly, making a small indent in the middle. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the apple mixture into the centre of each pastry. Cover with a clean tea towel or plastic bag and set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes.\nBrush with egg wash and then bake for 15\u201320 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.\nPlace the cooked pastries on cooling racks and brush them with apricot glaze while they are still hot. Leave to cool completely.\nMeanwhile, mix all the icing ingredients together until smooth. Transfer to a paper piping bag and pipe lines across the pastry to finish.",

(You may not need all of the water. Take care not to overwork the mixture.)\nRoll the dough into a ball, wrap it in cling film and chill it for 20 minutes.\nWhen the dough has chilled, roll it out onto a lightly floured work surface into a 40cm x 20cm/16in x 8in rectangle.

Simmer for 1-2 minutes, then remove from the heat and transfer the mixture to a bowl.\nDust the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re with a layer of icing sugar to prevent a skin from forming as it cools.

Whisk in the butter, stir in the cream and continue to simmer for 5 minutes, stirring all the time, until the sauce is creamy and golden-brown. Remove from the heat.\nFor the Chantilly cream, whisk the cream, icing sugar and vanilla extract together until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl.\nTo serve, pour the sauce over the pudding. The Chantilly cream can be served on the side for guests to help themselves.",

Then stir in the apple and calvados.\nBefore you make the pancakes put a large plate in a warm oven or a warming-drawer so that as you make them they can be kept warm, covered with some foil.\nTo make the pancakes, melt the butter in the frying pan, then tip it into a cup. To make your first pancake, heat the pan over a medium heat until it is really hot then use 1 tbsp of the batter to make each pancake, cook until it becomes crisp at the edges and is a lovely golden colour underneath, then, using a palette knife or spatula, turn the cr\u00eape over and cook the other side until crisp and golden (this should take about 45 seconds on each side.)\nRemove the cr\u00eape to a warm plate. Use a wodge of kitchen paper to lubricate the pan again with melted butter, then continue cooking the pancakes until the batter is all used up. When you are ready to serve the pancakes, transfer them to warmed serving plates, giving each person three or four, lightly dusted with caster sugar. Then combine the cream and calvados, put a little on each serving and hand the rest round separately. For a special occasion you could flame these by leaving them piled on a large plate, dusting with caster sugar, then warming 3 tbsp of calvados in a small pan - light it with a match and pour the flaming calvados over the pancakes. When the flame has died down serve each person three or four pancakes with pouring cream, served separately.",

Gradually add the beaten egg and the egg yolks and blend until smooth and well combined. Bring the dough mixture together with your hands, wrap it in cling film and transfer to the fridge to chill for 30-45 minutes.\nMeanwhile, grease a high-sided 20cm/8in spring form cake tin with butter. Add a small amount of flour and turn the tin to coat the sides and bottom, shaking out any excess. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\nRoll out two thirds of the chilled pastry onto a clean, floured work surface, until it is almost twice as wide as the diameter of the cake tin. Using the rolling pin, lift the pastry and lay it over the cake tin to line the base and sides. Gently press the pastry into the corners of the tin, trimming off any excess pastry, then prick the base of the pastry case several times with a fork.\nCover the pastry with a sheet of greaseproof paper and fill it with rice or dried beans. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is pale golden-brown. Remove from the oven, discard the beans and greaseproof paper and leave the pastry to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 170C/325F/Gas 3.\nFor the filling, place the sultanas and the orange juice into a bowl and leave for 30-40 minutes, or until the sultanas are plump.\nSprinkle the semolina flour over the base of the cooled pastry case. Arrange half of the apple slices in a single layer on the base of the pastry case. Scatter the apple layer with the soaked sultanas, then sprinkle over half of the caster sugar and half of the cinnamon. Repeat the process with the remaining apple slices, sugar and cinnamon.\nFor the pastry lid, roll out the remaining one third of pastry onto a clean, floured work surface, until it is large enough to cover the cake tin. Brush the rim of the pastry case with some of the beaten egg and place the pastry lid on top of the pie. Trim off any excess pastry. Seal the pastry lid to the pastry case by crimping the edges of the pastry lid with a fork.\nWith a knife, make two small holes in the centre of the pastry lid to allow steam to escape. Brush the pastry lid with the remaining beaten egg, then transfer to the oven and bake for 35-40 mins, or until golden-brown.\nTo serve, place a slice of the apple pie onto a serving plate and spoon a portion of clotted cream alongside.",

With a fork, prick the bottom of the tart. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, for the filling, heat the butter, lemon juice and 15g/1oz of the sugar in a small saucepan until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved.

When the pastry is pale golden-brown and the apples have caramelised, sprinkle the tart with a tablespoon of sugar and pour the custard mixture into the tart, bake for a further 10 minutes, until the filling mixture has just set.\nTo serve, remove the tart from the oven and set aside for 1 hour to cool slightly, then carefully remove the tart ring.

Take the pan off the heat, place on a cold, heatproof surface and let the apricots cool.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease the sides of the springform cake tin and line the bottom with baking parchment.\nRemove 5 of the dried apricots and tear each in half, then set aside. Discard the cardamom husks, leaving the seeds in the pan.\nPour and scrape out the sticky contents of the pan into the bowl of a food processor.

Scrape into the prepared tin and smooth with a spatula. Arrange the apricot halves around the circumference of the tin.\nBake for 40 minutes, though if the cake is browning up a lot before it\u2019s actually ready, you may want to cover loosely with foil at the 30-minute mark. When it\u2019s ready, the cake will be coming away from the edges of the tin, the top will feel firm, and a cake tester will come out with just one or two damp crumbs on it.\nRemove the cake to a wire rack. If you\u2019re using apricot jam to decorate, you may want to warm it a little first so that it\u2019s easier to spread; rose petal jam is so lusciously soft-set, it shouldn\u2019t need any help. Stir a teaspoon of lemon juice into the jam and brush over the top of the cake, then sprinkle with the chopped pistachios and leave the cake to cool in its tin before removing to a plate.",

Remove the pan from the oven using an oven cloth to hold the handle of the pan \u2013 don\u2019t forget - it will be very hot.\nLeave the tart to stand for a couple of minutes to allow it to settle, then loosen the edges and place a large serving plate or board on top of the frying pan.

Oil this very lightly with sunflower oil.\nPut the ice cream in a large bowl and beat it with a rolling pin or something similar until soft enough to mould. Put it on a piece of baking parchment and shape it into a thin sausage 25\u201330cm/10-12in long and about 5cm/2in in diameter. Wrap in the parchment and put in the freezer until solid.\nTo make the Swiss roll, use an electric whisk or a mixer with a whisk attachment to whisk the eggs and sugar together for several minutes until pale, moussey and almost tripled in volume. The mixture should \u2018hold a trail\u2019 when the whisk is removed. Sift the flour over the egg mixture and fold it in lightly. Fold in one tablespoon of warm water.\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth it out so that it reaches the corners. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown and just firm to the touch.\nCut a sheet of parchment slightly larger than the Swiss roll tin and lay it on your work surface. Sprinkle the parchment with sugar. Tip the cooked sponge onto the parchment, base upwards. Carefully peel the parchment from the base of the sponge. Leave to cool completely.\nTo assemble the roll, first trim the two long sides of the sponge into neat, straight lines. Spread the jam over the sponge, leaving a 2cm/\u00bein gap at each short edge and a 4cm/1\u00bdin gap along one of the long edges.\nUnwrap the ice cream and place it lengthways across the sponge, close to the jammy edge. Use the parchment to help you roll the sponge around the ice cream. Use a bread knife to neatly trim each end of the roll. Place on a plate and serve straight away, in thick slices. You can wrap any uneaten roll and return it to the freezer. Take it out and let it stand for a few minutes so the sponge can soften slightly, before slicing again.",

Place the basin over a saucepan of barely simmering water, making sure the basin isn't touching the water. Remove the pan from the heat and wait for the chocolate to melt before beating it with a wooden spoon until smooth.\nNext beat the 2 egg yolks, first on their own and then into the warm chocolate mixture. As soon as the mixture has cooled, whisk the egg whites to the soft-peak stage then gently fold them into the chocolate mixture. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave it in the fridge for a minimum of an hour.\nDrain the cherries, discard the syrup, then place them in a shallow dish, spoon over the cherry brandy and leave aside till needed.\nTo make the base: first place the egg yolks in a bowl and whisk them with an electric hand whisk until they begin to thicken. Then add the caster sugar and continue to whisk, but be careful not to overdo this, stop when it falls off the whisk in ribbons. Now fold in the sifted cocoa powder. Then, using a clean bowl and beaters, whisk the egg whites to the soft-peak stage. Then take 1 large spoonful, fold it into the chocolatey mixture to slacken it, and gently fold in the rest of the egg whites.\nNow pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake the cake on the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes or until it's springy in the centre. It will look very puffy, but a little finger gently pressed into the centre should reveal that it is cooked. It's important not to overcook it, otherwise it will be difficult to roll.\nRemove it from the oven and leave it until it's absolutely cold, then turn it out on a sheet of greaseproof paper, which has been lightly dusted with sieved cocoa powder. Then carefully peel away the silicone paper.\nDrain the cherries again in a sieve placed over a bowl to catch the brandy and sprinkle all but 1 tbsp of the liqueur all over the base. Next remove the chocolate filling from the fridge and spread it carefully over the surface of the base. Next whip the double cream softly, and spread this over the chocolate filling, leaving a 2.5cm/1in border all round, then press the cherries into the cream.\nTake hold of one edge of the greaseproof paper beneath the cake, lift it and, as you lift, it will begin to come up. Just gently roll it over, pulling the paper away as it rolls.\nMelt the chocolate as before, taking great care not to overheat it, then pour it on to an upturned plate 15cm/6in in diameter. Then place in the fridge for about 45 minutes until it's set. The chocolate should be firm when you touch it.\nTo make the curls use a cheese slicer, or a very sharp knife. Start at one end and just pull the slicer or knife along the surface of the chocolate towards you until curls form. Place them in a plastic container. Put the container in the fridge.\nNow you can decorate the cake: spoon the jam into a small saucepan, add the reserved liqueur, warm gently and then brush over the surface. Place the chocolate curls all over. Finally dust the surface lightly with cocoa powder.",

Chill in the fridge for 25 minutes.\nUnwrap the chilled dough and butter layer. Place the chilled butter layer, short end facing towards you on a lightly floured surface and place the square of dough in the centre of the butter sheet. Make sure it is positioned neatly and covers almost to the edges. Lift the exposed butter sheet at the top and fold it down over the dough, then fold the exposed butter sheet at the bottom up over the top, so the dough is completely enclosed in the butter sheet.\nPlace the dough on a lightly floured surface, short end towards you.

Dust the work surface heavily with icing sugar and roll each piece of dough out very thinly, turning to coat in the sugar and to prevent sticking. Place the biscuits on the prepared trays and bake for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, carefully turn the biscuits and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown.

The flour will rise to the surface of the water to create a crust - this will prevent the artichokes from discolouring during cooking.\nMeanwhile, for the mayonnaise, fry the bacon in a frying pan over a high heat until the fat has melted and the meat is crisp. Set the pan aside to cool.\nBlend the egg yolks and mustard in a food processor until pale and creamy. With the motor still running, gradually add the rapeseed oil in a thin stream, until the mixture thickens to a mayonnaise (you may not need to add all of the oil).\nGradually add the melted fat from the bacon pan to the mayonnaise, drop by drop. Add the fried bacon and pulse the food processor until it has been incorporated into the mayonnaise. Season the mayonnaise with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nWhen the artichokes have cooked, remove them from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.\nServe the artichokes with a dollop of the mayonnaise.",

Trim the edges so that the sides are nice and straight and neat. Cut the pastry in half down the length and then into thirds across the width to give six 10x14cm/4x5\u00bdin rectangles.\nPut the pastry rectangles on the baking tray, cover with cling film and refrigerate for 20 minutes (or freeze for 10 minutes) for the pastry to firm up. It is important to do this so that when the puff pastry goes into the oven the flour cooks before the butter melts ensuring a much lighter pastry.\nPreheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (200C fan). Mix the cream cheese and lemon zest together in a small bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Trim the asparagus so that each stem is 10cm/4in long (you can use the trimmings to make a quick soup or add to a pasta sauce).\nOnce firm, remove the pastry from the fridge (or freezer) and use a sharp knife to mark a 1cm/\u00bdin wide border around each rectangle. Then, using a crosshatch pattern, mark the border so each pastry shape resembles a picture frame. Take a fork and prick the centre of each shape about 10 times, right through to the baking tray. Brush the border with the beaten egg (or milk), making sure that it does not go down the sides of the pastry (if this happens, wipe it away with your finger otherwise the egg will stick the layers of the pastry together and stop the pastry from rising).\nDivide the lemony cream cheese between the six tarts, spreading it out with the back of the spoon and making sure that it stays inside the \u2018frame\u2019. Lay five asparagus spears in a single layer, touching each other and pointing in the same direction on each tart, and push them down slightly.\nBake the tarts in the oven for 18-20 minutes, or until the pastry has puffed up nicely and is firm and golden-brown where it has risen.\nAbout 10 minutes before the tart is ready, pour about 4cm/1\u00bdin of water into a saut\u00e9 pan or a deep frying pan and bring to the boil over a high heat. Turn the heat down to bring the water to a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a very small bowl or tea cup and then slide the egg into the water. Repeat with all of the eggs, spacing them apart. Cook them for about 3-4 minutes, or until the white is cooked but the yolk still soft. Remove with a slotted spoon onto a warm plate.\nRemove the tarts from the oven and divide between six serving plates. Sit a poached egg on top of each tart and scatter over the parmesan and basil leaves. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil, if liked, and serve.",

Continue to simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half (about 2 minutes).\nWhisk the egg yolks with a pinch of salt in a bowl using an electric whisk. With the whisk running, slowly add the melted butter \u2013 drop by drop at first \u2013 until it has all been incorporated into the egg yolks.\nStrain the vinegar mixture through a fine sieve into the egg mixture, whisking until combined. (Discard the shallot and peppercorns.) Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then cover and keep warm in a bowl suspended over a pan of hot water.\nWorking quickly, return the pan of water used to poach the eggs to the heat and bring to the boil. Add the asparagus spears and boil for 3-4 minutes, or until the stems are just tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.\nReturn the poached eggs to the poaching water and re-heat for 20-30 seconds, then remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.\nTo serve, divide the asparagus spears equally among four serving plates. Top each portion with a poached duck egg and a few slivers of ham. Spoon over the warm hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle everything with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then serve.",

Then flip the dough over and knead the olives in.\nAt this point, the dough may be quite wet with olives flying all over the shop, but just keep pushing the rogue olives back into the dough. If everything is too wet, just add a small handful of flour to dough. Shape it into a 20cm/8in round and place on the warmed baking tray.\nRub a little flour onto the handle of a wooden spoon. Then, holding the handle horizontal to the bread, press down onto the loaf making an indent almost to the bottom of the tray.\nTurn handle so that it is at a 90 degree angle to the first line and push down again to make a cross.

You don\u2019t want to mix for too long and incorporate any air.\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, tap it on the worktop to release any trapped air, then level the surface. Bake on the lower shelf of the oven for 1 hour.\nAs soon as the hour is up, open the oven door, leaving it slightly ajar. Pop a wooden spoon in the door to keep it just open and let out the heat slowly. Now turn the oven off.\nDon\u2019t take the cheesecake out until the oven is completely cold \u2013 this recipe is more about patience than anything else. Once the oven is cool, put the cheesecake into the fridge to chill overnight.\nThe following day, make the honey salted caramel. Melt the butter in a small pan over a medium heat. Add the honey and cook on a medium\u2013 high heat for 10 minutes, until the caramel is golden brown. If it starts to catch, turn the heat down slightly.\nAfter 10 minutes, pour in the cream, give it a mix and allow it to just come to the boil. Take off the heat and stir in the salt. Set aside.\nFor the tiffin crumble, put the biscuits into a zip-lock bag and crush them very roughly. I like a good mix of big pieces, small bits and lots of crumbs. Empty into a bowl.\nMelt the butter and pour it onto the biscuits. Leave to cool for about 10 minutes, while you take the cheesecake out of the fridge and turn it out on to a serving plate or platter.\nAdd the sugar, chocolate and hazelnuts to the buttery biscuit chunks.\nNow for the back-to-front bit. Put the tiffin mixture on top of the cheesecake, but not in any neat fashion or packed tightly, just piled on top in peaks and troughs.\nReheat the caramel if it has cooled too much, and serve with slices of cheesecake and crumble.",

Cover the top with the cling film and return it to the freezer.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4, butter the sides of the cake tin and line the base with a disc of baking parchment.\nPlace the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave until just melted, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat and set aside.\nIn a large bowl or in an electric food mixer, cream the butter until soft. Add the sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Gradually add the eggs to the creamed butter mixture, beating all the time.\nBeat in the melted chocolate, then gently fold in the flour until combined.\nPour the batter into the prepared cake tin and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.\nRemove the cake from the oven and turn the temperature up to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (if cooking the meringue straight away).\nAllow the cake to cool down in the tin for 10 minutes, then loosen around the edges with a small, sharp knife and carefully remove the cake. Place on a wire rack to cool down fully.\nFor the meringue, in a large, spotlessly clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks when the whisk is removed.\nAdd half of the caster sugar and the cream of tartar and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed and the meringue is satiny and glossy. Fold in the remaining sugar with a metal spoon or spatula.\nFor the chocolate sauce, place the cream in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the chocolate and stir until just melted, then add the rum or brandy (if using). Set aside until ready to serve (reheat the sauce gently if needed).\nTo assemble, once the cake has cooled, place it in the middle of a baking tray (one that is completely flat, with no 'lip', so that the baked Alaska can be removed easily).\nTake the ice cream out of the freezer. With the help of the cling film, remove the ice cream from the pudding bowl and place it upside down on the cake, remove all the cling film.\nQuickly spoon over the meringue, spreading it thickly and in peaks over the ice cream and the sides of the cake right down to the baking tray. You can cook the baked Alaska immediately or you can return it to the freezer for up to an hour (it will take an extra 3-4 minutes in the oven if cooking from frozen).\nPlace in the centre of the hot oven for 3-4 minutes or until the meringue is set on the outside and golden in colour.\nCarefully transfer the baked Alaska to a serving plate, using a palette knife dipped in hot water to help you slide and push it onto the plate.\nServe immediately with the chocolate sauce.",

When cool enough to handle, turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.\nFor the apple pur\u00e9e, put the apples, butter, sugar and 2 tablespoons water into a lidded pan and cover. Place over a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the apples have become light and softened. Whisk the apples to a smooth pur\u00e9e, then set aside to cool.\nFor the baked Alaska, bring 50ml/2fl oz water and the caster sugar to the boil in a saucepan (CAUTION: Hot sugar can be dangerous as it boils over very quickly. Do not leave unattended).\nMeanwhile, whisk the egg whites in a large clean bowl, using a freestanding mixer or an electric whisk, until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.\nWhen the sugar reaches 121C on a sugar thermometer, remove the pan from the heat. With the whisk or mixer running slowly, carefully pour the sugar syrup into the whisked egg whites in a thin stream, taking care not to let the hot sugar hit the beaters as it may splash. Continue to whisk until all the syrup has been incorporated into the egg whites and the mixture is glossy. Continue to whisk the egg white mixture at a slow speed until it has almost completely cooled (about 5 minutes).\nCut a circle of sponge out using a plate or a cutter. Place the sponge circle on a heatproof serving plate and drizzle the calvados all over it. Spoon the apple pur\u00e9e on top of the sponge.\nShape the ice cream in the centre of the sponge base. Spread half of the meringue mixture all over the ice cream and sponge base using a palette knife, making sure there aren't any gaps. Transfer the remaining meringue mixture to a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe it over the top of the meringue layer to decorate.\nUsing a chefs\u2019 blow torch, heat the piped meringue all over until it caramelises to a light golden-brown. Alternatively, heat your oven to its highest setting and place the baked Alaska into the oven for a few minutes.\nFor the saut\u00e9ed apples, heat a medium frying pan and add the butter, once hot add the apples and cook until golden-brown. Finish with the brandy and reduce until most of the liquid has evaporated.\nPlace the baked Alaska on a serving plate and serve the saut\u00e9ed apples alongside.",

You can leave the smaller leaves close to the florets \u2013 they will go nice and crispy when roasted. Turn the cauliflower upside down and, using a small paring knife, carefully cut a hollow in the middle of the central stalk to help the cauliflower cook evenly. Take a casserole or lidded saucepan and half-fill it with water from the kettle and bring to the boil. Add salt to the pan, add the cauliflower, cover and simmer for 6 minutes. Drain the cauliflower and return to the pan off the heat, put the lid back on and leave the cauliflower to steam for 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, take another casserole dish and place over a medium heat. Heat the coconut oil , then add the ginger, chillies and garlic and cook for a few minutes, until fragrant. Stir in the mustard seeds and continue cooking until the garlic has softened. Add the turmeric and a big pinch of salt.\nPreheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.\nPour the coconut milk into the casserole dish, stir well and season with a little pepper. Place the steamed cauliflower in a colander to drain off any water. When the milk starts to bubble gently, turn off the heat and place the cauliflower in the dish, then baste it with the coconut-spice mixture. Add the lemon halves to the dish and scatter the potatoes around the cauliflower so they sit in the coconut milk.\nBake in the oven, basting the cauliflower occasionally with the sauce in the dish, for 40\u201345 minutes. You want it to catch a little on top. To test if the cauliflower is cooked, insert a small sharp knife into the middle \u2013 it should be really tender and the potatoes and cauliflower should have soaked up most of the sauce. Carefully remove the lemons and leave to cool slightly before squeezing them over the aloo gobi. Transfer the aloo gobi to a serving dish.\nWhile the aloo gobi is baking, prepare the flatbreads. Place the flour, baking powder and yoghurt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture forms a ball. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, this can be done in a bowl using a fork to begin with, followed by your hands.\nTip the dough out on a clean work surface that is lightly dusted with flour. Knead for a minute or two. Put the dough into a flour-dusted bowl and cover with a plate. Leave to rise for 10\u201315 minutes. It won\u2019t rise like normal dough, but it may puff up slightly.\nDust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour and divide the dough into four equal pieces. Using your hands, pat and flatten out the dough and then use the rolling pin to roll each piece into a circle that is roughly 20cm/8in in diameter and 2\u20133mm thick.\nPlace a large frying pan or griddle pan that is slightly larger than your flatbreads over a medium heat. Once hot, cook each flatbread for 1\u20132 minutes on each side, turning with tongs, until nicely puffed up.\nServe the aloo gobi with the yoghurt, almonds, coriander and flatbreads, if using.",

Place in the oven to cook the vegetables until completely tender, but still holding their shape: this will take about 45 minutes.\nCarefully open up the foil so that the vegetables are now exposed, then return to the oven for another 5\u201310 minutes to brown.\nMeanwhile, toss the spigarello and kale with the oil, salt and sugar in a separate baking tray and bake in the oven until crisp (about 8\u201310 minutes, but keep an eye on it as the greens can easily brown.\nRemove both trays from the oven: the autumn vegetables should be tender, buttery and golden-brown and the leaves crisp. Keep warm.\nTo make the chestnut broth, bring everything to a simmer with 300g/10\u00bdoz of water and cook for 5 minutes. Leave to cool slightly and then blend in a blender or food processor until smooth.\nTo assemble, put the grapes in a small bowl and drizzle over the white balsamic vinegar and smoked rapeseed oil. Put the vegetables into a large warm bowl and drizzle over the juices from the roasting tray.\nDivide the vegetables between 4 plates, scatter the lemon thyme over the vegetables, and top with the flavoured grapes, then scatter over the crisp leaves. Drizzle some broth over the top and serve.",

Cover with cling film and put in the fridge to chill.\nPour the milk into a pan and warm gently until it\u2019s about body temperature \u2013 feeling neither warm nor cold when you dip your finger in.\nTo mix by hand, rub the yeast into the flour, then rub in the butter. Make a well in the centre and add the sugar and salt, then the eggs and milk. Use a plastic spatula to mix the dough for 2\u20133 minutes you have a wet dough. Turn out onto a work surface and knead to form a smooth dough.\nTo mix in a mixer, place the cold butter between two sheets of baking paper and bash it with the end of a rolling pin to soften and break it up into small pieces. Break up the yeast with your fingers and mix with the flour.\nPut the milk and eggs into the bowl of a food mixer, then add the yeast and flour, together with the sugar and salt. Cover the butter in the flour and tear the butter into a few pieces. Mix on a slow speed for 4 minutes, then turn the speed to medium and continue to mix until you have a dough which comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl. (Don\u2019t be tempted to turn up the speed, but let the dough come together in its own time.)\nLightly dust your work surface with flour and form the dough into a ball. Put the dough into your (lightly floured) bowl, cover with a cloth and leave to rest for 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, prepare your brie. Make some diagonal slashes in the top of the brie, place some slivers of garlic, fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs and drizzle some olive oil all over the top. Place a few thin slices of herb butter on top.\nPreheat oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.\nOnce your dough has rested, remove from the bowl and cut in half. Press half of the dough out to fit your baking ring, place onto a piece of greaseproof paper and lift onto the ring on a baking tray. Place the brie into the dough and leave, covered, in a warm place for an hour.\nBrush the dough edges with egg wash and drizzle the brie with a little aniseed liqueur and olive oil. Bake the brie for 40\u201360 minutes until golden and melted in the centre.\nServe with toast, potatoes and meats to dip into the cheese. Once the cheese has gone, fill the centre with a green salad.",

Pour into the lined tray. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 110C/90C Fan/Gas \u00bc and bake for a further 25 minutes. It should still have a slight wobble.\nTurn off the oven and leave the cheesecake to cool in the oven for 1\u00bd hours. Leave the oven door open for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture.\nFor the feuilletine base, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn't touch the water. Leave to cool a little. Blend the pistachios, hazelnuts, flaked almonds, sugar and hazelnut oil in a blender to a course consistency. Transfer to a mixing bowl and mix in the nibbed almonds and feuilletine. Mix in the melted chocolate. Spread the mixture between two pieces of silicon paper to a 5mm/\u00bcin thickness. Store in the fridge for 1 hour, or until fully set.\nRemove the top sheet of silicon paper. Trim to the size of the cheesecake tray, reserving the trimmings. Turn out the cheesecake onto the base and return to the fridge.\nFor the blow torch pear, put equal amounts of sugar and water and bring to a boil. Add the pear and poach for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and lift the pear out of the sugar syrup. Leave to cool, then cut into 1cm/\u00bdin cubes. Sprinkle over the sugar and use a blow torch to caramelise the sugar lightly.\nFor the tomato caramel, carefully blow torch the tomatoes, then leave to cool. Peel off the skins, then quarter the tomatoes and discard the pulp. Weigh out 400g/14oz tomato flesh and set aside.\nPlace the sugar in a heavy-based pan and heat until it reaches a walnut brown, to make a dry caramel. Stir in tomato flesh. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes have broken down. Stir in the lime zest and juice. Remove from the heat and leave to cool completely. Transfer to a squeezy bottle and refrigerate.\nTo assemble, cut the cheesecake into eight 5x11cm/2x4in pieces. Place each in the centre of a plate. Break up the feuilletine trimmings and scatter on the plates, sticking two out of each slice of cheesecake to give height. Scatter around cubes of poached pear. Add a spoonful of pear sorbet. Drizzle the cold tomato caramel around the each plate and serve.",

Drizzle the oil in the centre of a 20cm/8in square of aluminium foil and sit the garlic, cut-side down on top. Wrap up loosely, sit on a small baking tray and pop in the oven straight away (even if the oven is not hot enough) to cook for about 50-55 minutes, or until very soft.\nFor the marinara sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan over a low heat. Add the onion and cook for about 6-8 minutes, or until beginning to soften, stirring regularly. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Stir the tomatoes, thyme, sugar (if you think it needs a little sweetening) and some salt and pepper. Turn down the heat so that the mixture is just simmering and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the flavours have intensified.\nMeanwhile, make the courgette fritters. Line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Beat the eggs in a large shallow bowl. Put the flour into another and stir in a couple of large pinches of salt and lots of pepper. Divide the breadcrumbs, parmesan and rosemary evenly between two large shallow bowls and set aside.\nTrim the courgette ends and slice one lengthways into three evenly-sized slices. Cut each slice into three long, evenly-sized strips and then in half across their width to give 18 chips. Repeat with the second courgette to give 36 chips in total. Each one will be about 1.5cm/\u00bein wide and 7-8cm/3in long, depending on the size of your courgettes.\nWorking with a few at a time, toss the courgette batons in the flour until well coated - this will help the egg to stick in the next stage. Toss through the beaten egg and, after allowing the excess egg to drip off, roll them around in one of the batches of breadcrumbs to stick all over evenly. Arrange in a single layer on the baking trays as you go. Repeat until all of the courgettes are coated, using the second batch of breadcrumbs once the first has been used up.\nThe marinara sauce will probably be nice and thick at this stage. If it's too thick to pour, stir in a little water. Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper, add the basil leaves and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.\nSpray the courgettes with the oil and place in the oven for 20 minutes. If tight on space, nestle the garlic parcel onto one of the courgette trays. Half way through cooking time, remove the courgettes, turn them over, give another spray and pop them back in the oven - this time on the opposite shelves to what they were already on. Once cooked, they should be lightly browned and very crisp all over.\nOnce softened, remove the garlic from the oven and, when cool enough to handle, unwrap it and squeeze the garlic cloves from their papery skins into a bowl. Mash lightly with a fork and then add the cream cheese, yoghurt and chives and stir everything together really well. Season to taste and spoon into a serving bowl.\nSpoon the marinara sauce in a serving bowl. Pile the courgettes onto a serving platter and serve with the lemon wedges.",

Add a twist of black pepper and then blend to a paste. You may need a little more olive oil to make it smooth. (Adults should supervise this.) Spoon into a jar and store in the fridge until needed.\nAdult\u2019s job: Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Prick the baking potatoes all over with a fork and place in the oven to bake for 1-1\u00bd hours. (Oven timers are great if you\u2019re at work \u2013 put the potatoes in the cold oven in the morning and set it to come on 90 minutes before you get home.) If you are using leftover baked potatoes, they will need to be warmed up again or the gnocchi will taste doughy - put them into a warm oven for 10 minutes or microwave on high for 30 seconds.\nKid\u2019s job: If you are using freshly baked potatoes allow them to cool enough to be handled safely and then slice them in half and kids can scoop out the flesh into a large bowl. Add any cooked squash or carrot if you are making the orange option.\nKid\u2019s job: Mash the cooked potato with a masher or a large fork, until it is smooth.\nKid\u2019s job: Knock the egg gently on the work surface to crack it \u2013 cracking on a flat surface will create less little bits of shell. Pull the egg open over a small bowl. Pull out any bits of shell that have fallen into the bowl. (Wash your hands after handling eggs.)\nKid\u2019s job: Add the egg, flour, grated cheese, black pepper and nutmeg (and the spinach or herbs if you are making the green version) to the bowl and mix together with your hands until you have a smooth dough. If the dough is sticky you can add more flour \u2013 it should feel like play dough.\nKid\u2019s job: Divide the dough into four balls. On a lightly floured surface or table roll the potato dough into a long sausage and then, using a table knife cut it into 15 x 2cm/1in pieces.\nKid\u2019s job: Press each gnocchi with a fork to make a ridged pattern (this helps them cook and also helps sauce stick to them). Repeat with the rest of the dough.\nAdult\u2019s job: Bring a large pan of water to the boil with a pinch of salt. Place 10 gnocchi at a time carefully into the water and boil for about 30 seconds - the gnocchi will rise to the surface of the water when they are cooked.\nAdult\u2019s job: Remove the gnocchi from the water with a slotted spoon into a warmed bowl and stir in a teaspoonful of the pesto. Add another batch of gnocchi to the pan of water and repeat until all of the gnocchi are cooked. Serve immediately with a green salad.",

            "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4, with a shelf placed in the lower third of the oven.\nPlace a large square of aluminium foil on a flat surface. Place the springform tin in the middle of the foil. Gently fold up the foil around the sides of the tin. Take care to do this gently so that you don't create any holes in the foil (the idea is to create a waterproof skin around the tin). Press the foil around the edges of the tin. Place a second large square of foil underneath the tin, and repeat. Gently crimp the top of the foil sheets around the top edge of the pan. Make sure no water can get in as this would ruin the crust.\nIn a food processor, pulse the biscuits and melted butter until finely ground and combined.\nPut all but three tablespoons of the crumbs in the bottom of the springform tin. Gently press down the crumbs using your fingers, until you have an even layer at the bottom of the pan, with just a slight rise along the inside edges of the tin. Use the reserved crumbs to fill in any holes or uneven patches.\nBake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for approximately 10 minutes.\nReduce the oven temperature to 160C/320F/Gas 3.\nTo make the filling, add the cream cheese to the bowl of a freestanding mixer. Add the soured cream, double cream, sugar and eggs. Mix on a medium speed for 5-6 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy. Mix in the vanilla pod seeds. (Remember to scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl, and scrape up any thicker bits of cream cheese that have stuck to the bottom of the mixer that the paddle attachment has failed to incorporate.)\nFor the topping, in a saucepan gently heat the raspberry jam with 120ml/4fl oz water. Stir to form a smooth liquid. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve to remove any seeds. Set aside.\nTo cook the cheesecake, place the foil-wrapped springform tin in a large, high-sided roasting tin. Fill a kettle with water and set it to boil.\nPour the cream cheese filling into the springform tin over the biscuit base. Smooth the top with a spatula or the back of a spoon.\nPlace the roasting tin - with the springform tin sat in it - in the oven, on a low shelf.\nCarefully pour the boiling water into the roasting tin (take care not to burn yourself on the hot oven), until the water reaches halfway up the side of the springform tin. (Alternatively, you can add the water before putting the tin in the oven - whichever is easier for you.)\nBake for 1\u00bd hours, or until just set.\nTurn off the oven and open the door slightly. Leave the cheesecake in the oven to cool very slowly for an hour (this gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking).\nCover the top of the springform tin with foil, so that it doesn't actually touch the cheesecake. Chill in the fridge for a minimum of four hours, or overnight.\nTake the cake from the fridge and remove the foil from around the tin. To remove the cheesecake from the tin, carefully run a pallet knife around the edge of the cheesecake. Open the springform latch, ease open the tin and carefully lift it away. You can serve the cheesecake on the base of the tin, but, if you wish to remove it, carefully slide a pallet knife under the cheesecake to loosen it from the tin, then slightly lift one edge of the cheesecake and slide it onto a serving plate.\nTo serve, decorate the top of the cheesecake with fresh raspberries covered in the topping.",

Line the base of a 23cm/9in springform cake tin with baking parchment, brushing a little of the melted butter on the base to help the paper stick. Break up the gingernut biscuits in a food processor to give fine crumbs. Mix well into the melted butter and then tip into the bottom of the prepared tin. Press the mixture well into the bottom so it is packed tight and level. Place in the fridge to set for 20 minutes or so while you get on with the filling.\nFor the filling, put the cream cheese, ricotta, cream, eggs, sugar, cornflour and vanilla seeds into a large bowl and beat like mad for a few minutes until everything is combined and smooth. An electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment will make this easier than by hand. Once the biscuit base is set, remove the tin from the fridge and pour this mixture in on top.\nSit on a baking tray and pop into the oven for 40-45 minutes. The cheesecake should be just set with a little wobble. When it reaches this stage, turn off the oven and leave to cool in there for about an hour. This (usually) stops the cheesecake from cracking. Also avoid moving the cheesecake around at this stage to help prevent cracking. However, don\u2019t worry if it does crack as it will still taste delicious and will be nicely decorated.\nOnce it has had an hour of cooling, remove the cheesecake from the oven.

Stir in the caster sugar, then add the white chocolate and cranberries and mix until well combined. Add the eggs and mix with your hands until the mixture comes together in a smooth dough, adding milk if needed to loosen the dough. Roll the mixture out on a floured work surface to a thickness of 6mm/\u00bcin.\nCut circles from the dough using a 5cm/2in pastry cutter \u2013 this mixture should make about 50.\nGrease a heavy frying pan with butter and heat over a high heat. Once hot, reduce the heat, place a few Welsh cakes into the hot pan and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Keep an eye on the heat, increasing or decreasing as necessary. If the pan is too cool the Welsh cakes will spread, if too hot, they will burn on the outside.\nOnce the Welsh cakes are cooked, place them onto greaseproof paper sprinkled with caster sugar. Sprinkle with caster sugar and set aside to cool. Repeat with the remaining Welsh cakes.\nFor the cheesecake, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Put the digestive biscuits in a freezer bag and crush them gently with a rolling pin. Melt the butter in pan and mix in the crushed biscuits and spices. Press this mixture into a 23cm/9in springform tin and bake for 5\u201310 minutes, then set aside to cool.\nWhisk the cream cheese, flour, sugar, vanilla essence, eggs, egg yolk and soured cream in a bowl until well combined.\nCut up four or five of the Welsh cakes into chunky pieces and gently fold them into the mixture. Arrange some of the remaining Welsh cakes over the biscuit base until it is covered and then pour the cream cheese mixture on top. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the cheesecake is slightly wobbly in the centre but able to hold its shape.\nLeave to cool in the tin and serve in slices, warm or cold.",

Break up the digestive biscuits and the ginger biscuits and place them into the bowl of a food processor.\nPlace the butter in a heavy-based pan and melt gently.\nProcess the biscuits in the food processor, until the mixture has the consistency of fine breadcrumbs.\nLine the base of a 24cm/9in-10in loose-based spring-form cake tin with a round of greaseproof paper. Brush the bottom of the tin with some of the melted butter and place the round of greaseproof paper in the base.\nAdd the remaining melted butter to the biscuit crumbs in the food processor and process again briefly.\nTip the crumbs into the bottom of the cake tin. Using the back of a spoon, gently push the crumbs from the centre outward, until smooth and level. This will form the base of the cheesecake.\nBake the cheesecake base in the oven for 10-15 minutes until it's lightly browned and just set. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least five minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the filling. Place the cream cheese, cream, sugar and eggs in a large bowl. Using a grater, grate in the zest of the limes. Using an electric whisk, beat together on a low speed, until smooth.\nCarefully pour the filling onto the cooled base. If making the cheesecake in advance, you can prepare it to this stage, then chill in the refrigerator and bake the next day (allowing it to first reach room temperature).\nReturn the cheesecake to the oven and bake for about one hour, or until just set. Allow to cool completely, then place in the fridge and chill for about an hour.\nCarefully remove the cheesecake from the tin and place on a serving plate, using a palette knife to loosen the cake base from the bottom of the tin.\nFor the topping, use a sharp serrated knife to remove the top and bottom of the pineapple. Cut away the tough outer skin from the pineapple and cut in half lengthways. Using a mandoline, thinly slice half of the pineapple (be sure to use the finger guard if the mandoline has one). Reserve the other half for use in another dish. Place the pineapple slices into a bowl.\nCut the passion fruit in half and scoop out the pulp with a teaspoon. Add to the bowl with the pineapple and toss together well.\nWhip the cream in a clean bowl with a hand whisk. When soft peaks form, add icing sugar, to taste, and whisk gently until well blended.\nTo serve, spread the sweetened cream over the surface of the cheesecake and pile on the fresh fruit. Pour over the passion fruit juice from the bowl. Dust with icing sugar and serve in generous slices.",

Repeat until you have six layers.\nSprinkle the nut filling over the filo as evenly as possible but do not press down too much \u2013 it should not be too compressed. Top with more filo and butter and repeat until there are another six layers on top.\nScore the baklava into small diamonds by cutting just through to the filling in parallel lines. Bake for around 35 minutes until the top layer of pastry is a rich golden brown. Remove the baklava from the oven and leave to cool.\nMeanwhile, make the syrup. Put the sugar, honey and orange zest in a saucepan with 150ml/5fl oz water. Heat gently until the sugar and honey have melted and then simmer for around 10 minutes until the consistency is syrupy. Pour the syrup evenly over the pastry. Leave to cool completely, for at least an hour and preferably for a few hours if possible.\nFor the orange cream, put the cream in a large bowl with the orange zest. Whisk by hand or with an electric whisk until the cream is soft and billowy. Mix the icing sugar with the cardamom powder and stir this through the cream.\nRemove the baklava from the tin and cut back through the scored lines, this time cutting through to the base. Use a metal dough scraper or a long knife so you can just press down instead of pulling through. Serve with the orange cream or store in an airtight container.",

Incorporate the rest of the flour and the banana. Add a squeeze of lime juice to loosen the consistency slightly, then scrape the mixture into the pudding basin.\nCover the basin with a sheet of greaseproof paper (or foil) with a pleat folded down the middle (this lets the air expand during cooking). Put an upturned heatproof saucer or small trivet in a large, deep saucepan, and place the pudding basin on top. Add enough just-boiled water to the pan to come halfway up the sides of the basin. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and place over a low heat. Allow to steam in the gently simmering water for 2 hours, adding more water to the pan if necessary. (Make sure the pan does not boil dry.) The pudding is done when a skewer inserted into the centre of the pudding (through the foil or paper) comes out clean. When done, turn off the heat and carefully lift the basin from the water. Leave to stand for 5 minutes.\nDiscard the aluminium foil and paper. Run a cutlery knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen the sides. Carefully invert onto a deep plate and remove the basin.\nWhile the pudding is steaming, make the custard. Put the milk and the cream into a saucepan with the vanilla pod or extract. Bring almost to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave it so the flavours will infuse until it cools.\nWhisk the egg yolks and sugar together until pale with a foamy, aerated texture. Reheat the milk and cream again until just below boiling point. Strain the milk mixture through a sieve into a jug and rinse out the saucepan.\nSlowly pour the milk mixture over the eggs, whisking constantly as you do so, then pour back into the saucepan. Set over a very low heat and stir constantly until the custard has thickened slightly and you can draw a line through it when it coats the back of a spoon.\nStrain the custard again and stir in the banana liqueur, if using.\nTo serve, turn the pudding out onto a plate and serve with the custard.",

Stir in a little pearlescent food colour. Spoon into a squeezy bottle and cover the bodies of the sheep evenly to make the fleeces. Set aside in a cool place to allow the icing to set.\nSift remaining icing sugar and mix with the almond extract and enough water to make a thick icing. Transfer half the icing to a separate bowl. Add the black food colour to one and the silver to the other. Put into two disposable piping bags with small plain nozzles attached. Use the black icing to decorate the heads and legs of the sheep and the silver to pipe swirls on their fleeces. Allow the icing to set, then serve.",

Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nFor the pesto, grind the basil, pine nuts, parmesan and garlic to a rough paste in a pestle and mortar. Gradually pour in both the oils, stirring as you add them. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside, covered, until needed.\nTo prepare the pasta, dust the rollers of a pasta machine with flour. Cut the chilled pasta into three pieces and flatten each out to a thickness of about 1cm/\u00bdin.\nSet the pasta machine to its widest setting and feed one piece of dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand and collecting the rolled dough as it comes through the machine with the other.\nChange the setting on the pasta machine to the next thickest setting, dust the rollers with a little flour, then feed the same pasta sheet through the machine again, as before. Repeat this process three or four more times, flouring the machine and changing the setting down each time, until you reach the penultimate setting. As your pasta sheet becomes longer, cut it in half so that the rolling process is more manageable.\nRepeat the rolling process with the remaining two pieces of dough. Once all of the dough has been rolled out, you should have six long sheets of pasta.\nTo make the tortellini, place one long sheet of the pasta onto the work surface with the longest side facing you. Place two large basil leaves in the bottom half of the pasta, then fold the top half over the basil leaves. Set the pasta machine to its finest setting and pass the sheet through the machine again. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta sheets and large basil leaves.\nCut the pasta sheets into 9cm/4in discs using a cookie cutter. Place one small basil leaf into the centre of each, and top with one teaspoonful of ricotta.\nOne by one, brush the edges of each pasta disc with a little water. Bring the edges of each disc together to form a semi-circular shape, pressing the edges together with your fingertips to seal. Bring the pointed ends of the tortellini towards each other around your fingertip to form a ring, then press the corners together using your other hand.\nRepeat the process with the remaining pasta discs, basil and ricotta; you should end up with 20 tortellini.\nBring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Carefully lower the tortellini into the boiling water, in batches, and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface of the water. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl, keeping warm. Cook the remaining tortellini.\nAdd the pesto to the tortellini and mix gently until coated. Sprinkle over the pine nuts.\nTo serve, spoon the tortellini and pesto onto serving plates. Sprinkle some grated parmesan over each and garnish with a few small basil leaves.",

Six hours will give you a good strong stock to work with.\nAt the end of cooking time, strain the stock of all solid ingredients and discard them.\nTo reduce the stock, pour the liquid stock back into the pot and turn the heat up to medium. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, which will take about one hour, perhaps longer. The further you reduce the stock, the stronger and more intense it will be. The stock can be used as is, or can be reduced further or frozen for future use.",

The lemon juice will stabilise the egg whites, make them easier to work with and help to prevent over-whisking.\nAdd the sugar and continue to whisk until firm peaks form when the whisk is removed. Do not whisk beyond this stage - the egg whites will start to collapse and separate into dry froth and runny liquid, and you'll lose all the air that you've whisked in.\nWhen the chocolate has melted, remove the bowl from the heat. Whisk one-third of the egg whites into the hot chocolate quickly and vigorously, until thick and well combined. If you add the egg whites in too slowly, their cold temperature can make the hot chocolate seize, solidify and result in a lumpy mousse.\nFold the remaining egg whites into the chocolate mixture, using a spatula, until all of the egg white has been completely incorporated into the chocolate. Don't overmix at this stage as you'll knock out the air bubbles and the mousse will be dense.\nSpoon the mousse mixture into four Martini glasses. Chill in the fridge for 2\u20133 hours, or until set.\nAlternatively, use the mousse to make a hot chocolate soup. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Divide the mousse among four small ovenproof pudding bowls or ramekins. Place the pudding bowls into the oven and bake the chocolate mousses for 3\u20135 minutes, or until puffed slightly and warmed through.",

Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.\nNext gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don't worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. Now melt the 50g/2oz of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake.\nNow get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium and, to start with, do a test pancake to see if you're using the correct amount of batter. I find 2 tbsp is about right for an 18cm/7in pan. It's also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it's tinged gold as it should be. Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate.\nStack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper on a plate fitted over simmering water, to keep them warm while you make the rest.\nTo serve, sprinkle each pancake with freshly squeezed lemon juice and caster sugar, fold in half, then in half again to form triangles, or else simply roll them up. Serve sprinkled with a little more sugar and lemon juice and extra sections of lemon.",

            "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Get out a 20cm/8in springform tin and a roll of baking paper. Unfurl a long piece from the roll, and when it looks like you\u2019ve got enough to line the tin with an overhang of 5\u20137cm/2\u20132\u00bein, tear it off and press into the tin and down into the edges at the bottom. Now do the same again with a second piece, placing it perpendicular to the first so that the tin is entirely lined. Push this piece down too and don\u2019t worry about any pleats, creases and wrinkles; this is The Look. Sit something heavy in the tin to keep the paper in place while you get on with the cheesecake mixture.\nI use a freestanding mixer fitted with the flat paddle for this, but you could easily use a large bowl, wooden spoon and elbow grease. First beat the cream cheese with the sugar until light and smooth; I beat for quite a long time, certainly not under 2 minutes and it would be at least 5 minutes by hand. It is absolutely essential \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to repeat myself \u2013 that the cream cheese is at room temperature before you start.\nBeat in the eggs, one at a time, waiting for each one to be incorporated before adding the next. When they\u2019re all mixed in, pour in the soured cream, beating all the while. Once that is also incorporated, you can slow down the mixer a little (or risk getting cornflour all over yourself) and then beat in the salt, followed by the cornflour, a teaspoon at a time. Remove the bowl from the mixer, scrape down the sides with a silicon spatula and give everything a good stir.\nPour into the lined tin (removing whatever\u2019s been sitting in it, obviously), making sure no cheesecake mixture is left in the bowl. Rap the filled tin on the work surface about five times to get rid of any air bubbles.\nPlace in the oven and bake for 50 minutes, until the cheesecake is burnished bronze on top, even chestnut brown in places, and risen, like a dense souffl\u00e9. It will, however, still be very jiggly. It\u2019s meant to be. You\u2019ll think it\u2019s undercooked, but it will carry on cooking as it cools, and it should have a soft set anyway.\nTransfer the tin to a wire rack and leave to cool. It will sink in the middle a little, but that too is part of its traditional appearance. I reckon it\u2019s cool enough to eat after 3 hours, although you may need to leave it for a little longer. If you want to chill it in the fridge, do, but not for more than 30 minutes.\nMake the liquorice sauce once the cheesecake is out of the oven. If you have a bullet blender, you can pulverise the liquorice pellets first. Place the liquorice in a small saucepan with 300ml/10fl oz water. Stir in the sugar, then place over a low heat until the liquorice has all but dissolved, stirring to give it a bit of a nudge every now and again to help it melt. Turn up the heat and let it bubble away until reduced to 150ml/5fl oz \u2013 turning the heat down a bit if it looks like it\u2019s boiling over. I find this can take up to 20 minutes. Stir in a pinch of salt, if using, and leave to cool. It will have the texture of a syrup, which in effect, it is. Transfer to a serving jug.\nBefore serving, unclip and lift the sides of the tin up and away, and then lift the cheesecake up with the edges of the paper. Place this on a board and peel the paper back. Take it like that, rustically beautiful, to the table, along with the blackberries and the even blacker liquorice syrup. Just drizzle a little over the slices of cheesecake as you hand them out, allowing hard-core liquorice lovers to spoon more over as they eat.",

Return the chicken and the chorizo to the pot and stir in the stock, and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, and transfer to the oven, uncovered. Braise until the chicken legs are tender and the chicken is fully cooked through, this should take about 45 minutes.\nMeanwhile prepare the salad. Peel the outer layer of the artichokes, trim the stem and scoop away the inside.

Leave the yeast to activate for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy.\nMix the semolina, flour, salt and remaining sugar together in a large bowl. Add the olive oil, yoghurt, yeast mixture and 120ml/4fl oz warm water. Use your hands to bring the ingredients together to form a soft dough. The dough should feel slightly sticky. If your dough is too dry, gradually add a little extra warm water, a tablespoon at a time, until you get the right consistency. If it\u2019s too sticky, add a bit more plain flour.\nLightly dust a work surface with semolina and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic \u2013 to check that it has been kneaded enough, press the dough with your finger and it should bounce back, if not keep going for a few more minutes. Divide the dough in half and shape each into a round ball. Cover each loaf with cling film and leave to rest in a warm place for 15 minutes.\nDivide the dough into 6 equal balls. Using your hands, flatten each ball into a 6mm/\u00bcin-thick disc and dust both sides with semolina flour. Place the flatbreads on a tray or work surface in a warm place, leaving at least 5cm/2in between each. Cover with cling film and leave to rise for about an hour, or until they double in size \u2013 they may need longer if the room is cold.\nLightly oil a frying pan, ideally heavy based, over a medium heat. When hot, place a flatbread in the pan and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack while you cook the other flatbreads in the same way. Leave the bread to cool for a few minutes before serving.",

Bring the liquid to a simmer and skim off any froth or scum that rises to the surface. Once the water is reasonably clear, place a crumpled piece of baking parchment, cut to the diameter of the pan, on top of the pork belly. This will help to keep the moisture in the pan during cooking.\nGently simmer the pork belly for two hours until it is very tender. There should be no resistance when you pierce it with a knife. Let the belly cool completely in the cooking liquid.\nLift the cooled pork out of the pan and place on a baking tray. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour until it has firmed up, which will make it easier to slice. Once firm, remove the pork belly from the refrigerator and cut into individual portions.\nWhile the pork is cooking, make the bacon mayonnaise. Heat the oil in a small pan over a low heat, add the bacon and gently fry until it has rendered all of its fat.\nStrain the bacon through a fine sieve and reserve the bacon flavoured oil. (The bacon is not used in this recipe.) Let the oil cool to room temperature before you begin to make the mayonnaise or it may split.\nWhisk the egg yolk, vinegar and mustard together in a large bowl. Whisking continuously, drizzle the cooled bacon oil slowly into the bowl in a steady stream to create an emulsion. Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and soy sauce, which will thin down the mayonnaise. Taste and adjust the seasoning to taste. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.\nFor the tomato chutney, heat the oil in saucepan and add the onion. Cook the onion over a medium heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, paprika and lemongrass, and stir well. Gently cook for another five minutes, stirring every once in a while.\nHeat the sugar in another dry pan until it melts and begins to caramelise to a golden-brown colour. Add the red wine vinegar and fish sauce to the caramel. If the caramel hardens upon contact with the liquid, stir the mixture for a few minutes until it dissolves. Pour this over the onion mixture and add the lime juice. Cook for a minute and add the diced tomatoes and stir well. Cook for a further minute then remove the pan from the heat.\nWhen you are about ready to serve, remove the thick rind from the pork belly. Heat a thin layer of olive oil in a frying pan. Add the pork belly pieces and fry for about two minutes on each side until golden-brown and warmed through. Toast the brioche buns and spread some bacon mayonnaise on the bottom halves. Arrange a few lettuce leaves on each brioche base, then place pork belly pieces and a generous spoonful of tomato chutney on top. Cover with the brioche lids and serve at once.",

Remove from the oven and set aside to cool in the tin.\nMeanwhile, for the buttercream, heat the sugar and 50ml/2fl oz water in a small saucepan until the temperature of this sugar syrup reaches 121C (use a sugar thermometer for this).\nUsing an electric whisk or free-standing mixer, whisk the egg yolks with 30ml/1fl oz water for 5 minutes on full speed until pale and fluffy.\nReduce the speed of the electric beaters, then drizzle the sugar syrup in a thin stream down the side of the bowl. (Caution: do not pour the hot syrup directly onto the beaters). Whisk until the mixture thickens and looks silky, then continue to whisk until the mixture cools completely.\nReduce the speed of the beaters to a slow speed, then whisk in the rum.

Drag a fork lightly and unevenly through the buttercream to make it look like tree bark. Refrigerate for a further 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, for the chocolate sauce, bring the milk and cream just to the boil in a saucepan. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chocolate until smooth and melted.\nJust before serving, dust the b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl with a little cocoa powder and garnish with grated chocolate or chocolate curls.

A paella pan is best, but if you don\u2019t have one, use a very wide, shallow non-stick saucepan, flameproof casserole dish or saut\u00e9 pan.\nPlace the pan over a medium heat. Season the chicken thighs with salt and black pepper and fry them for about five minutes, turning every now and then until lightly coloured. Add the chorizo and cook for 30 seconds more, turning once. Transfer the chicken and chorizo to a large heatproof bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.\nAdd the onions to the pan and fry gently for 4\u20135 minutes until softened and very lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Add the peppers and green beans to the onions and cook for two minutes until they are beginning to soften. Stir in the garlic, smoked paprika, saffron, bay leaf and rice and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until the rice is glistening all over.\nReturn the chicken and chorizo to the pan, along with any juices. Stir well, then pour in the chicken stock and season with black pepper. Stir once or twice and bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Cook for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nTip the mussels into the partly cooked rice mixture and stir once more, making sure they are well tucked into the hot rice and steaming liquid. Return to a simmer and cook for three minutes or until most of the mussels have opened, stirring occasionally.\nScatter the squid and prawns over the top of the paella and stir well. Continue cooking for 4\u20135 minutes until the squid and prawns are cooked, the rice is tender and almost all the liquid has been absorbed. The prawns should be completely pink when cooked.\nIt\u2019s important not to keep stirring after the squid and prawns are added \u2013 you want the rice to become lightly browned and a bit sticky at the sides of the pan as this adds flavour. Keep an eye on the heat though, as you don\u2019t want the rice to burn. Add a splash more water if the paella begins to look very dry before the rice is ready. Pick out any mussels that haven\u2019t opened by the end of the cooking time and chuck them away. Serve hot with lemon wedges for squeezing.",

Then place it over a low heat and let it come very slowly up to simmering point, which will take approximately 5 minutes. Then remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the milk into a jug, discarding the flavourings.\nAll this can be done ahead of time, but when you want to make the sauce, use the same washed pan and place it over a gentle heat. Begin by melting the butter gently - don't over-heat it or let it brown, as this will affect the colour and flavour of the sauce. As soon as the butter melts, add the flour and, over a medium heat and using a small pointed wooden spoon, stir quite vigorously to make a smooth, glossy paste. Now begin adding the infused milk a little at a time - about 1fl oz/25ml first of all and stir again vigorously. Then, when this milk is incorporated, add the next amount and continue incorporating each bit of liquid before you add the next. When about half the milk is in, switch to a balloon whisk and start adding large amounts of milk, but always whisking briskly. Your reward will be a smooth, glossy, creamy sauce.\nNow turn the heat down to its lowest setting and let the sauce cook for 5 minutes, whisking from time to time. While that's happening, taste and season with salt and freshly milled black pepper. If you wish to keep the sauce warm, all you do is pour it into a warmed jug and cover the surface with clingfilm to stop a skin from forming, then place the jug in a pan of barely simmering water.",

            "instructions": "For the base, roll the puff pastry out on a lightly floured work surface into a 28cm/11in circle about 5mm thick. Transfer the pastry to a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Cover with cling film and place in the fridge for at least one hour.\nFor the sour onions, place a frying pan over a medium heat and add the cider, cider vinegar and demerara sugar. Bring the pan to the boil and place the onion segments in the liquid. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook for 5-8 minutes until they start to soften. Turn the onions over and cook for a further five minutes.\nWhen soft, remove the pan from the heat, put the onions on a baking tray. Use a blowtorch to char them (alternatively char them under a hot grill). Leave to cool.\nFor the base, preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.\nPrick the puff pastry all over using a fork. In a small bowl or mug, mix the egg yolk and double cream together and brush it on top of the pastry. Place the pastry in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until risen, crisp and golden-brown. Turn the oven down to 110C/225F/Gas \u00bc and continue to \u2018dry\u2019 the pastry out for a further 15 minutes. Do not let it burn.\nOnce the pastry is crisp and dried out, remove it from the oven and leave to cool for five minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\nFor the beef, toss the bavette steak strips in the cornflour and shake off any excess.\nHeat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the beef strips in batches (do not crowd the pan) and fry until crisp, this will take about 6-8 minutes. Once crisp, drain on kitchen paper and season with salt and cayenne pepper while the beef is still warm.\nBrush the pastry with the beef extract, spread a layer of onion marmalade on top and add the beef. Warm through in the oven for a few minutes.\nFor the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche dressing, whisk the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and blue cheese in a bowl until thick. Fold in the chopped chives and season with salt and pepper. If the mixture is too thick, add a little water to loosen it up so it can be drizzled on top of the pizza.\nTake the pizza out of the oven, spoon some of the blue cheese and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche dressing on top and garnish with watercress. Serve immediately.",

Stir in the beef stock.\nReturn the beef to the pan and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with a tight fitting lid and braise on the bottom shelf of the oven for two hours, or until the meat is tender - check during the cooking time to ensure that the meat doesn't become too dry. If it does, add a splash of boiled water.\nFor the dumplings, line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Sift the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Add the suet and rosemary and bind together with enough cold water to form a soft dough.\nUsing floured hands and working as lightly fingered as possible, divide the mixture into eight and shape into oval dumplings. Place on a baking tray slightly spaced apart.\nBake the dumplings on the shelf above the beef for the last 25 minutes of the beef\u2019s cooking time, until they are puffed up and cooked through.\nMeanwhile, for the mash, boil the potatoes in a pan of boiling, salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and press through a potato ricer into a warm bowl. Mix in the horseradish, butter and cream. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nServe the mash with the beef and dumplings.",

Once cooked, remove the pie filling from the dish and set aside to cool.\nRemove the puff pastry from the fridge and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll the pastry out into a rectangle approximately 50x30cm/20x12in. Slice the butter and lay this over two-thirds of the dough. Fold the unbuttered dough third over the buttered one, then flip that over the remaining buttered third so that the butter is wrapped inside the dough. Take a rolling pin and lightly roll the upper surface of the dough to press out any air bubbles. Seal the edges with a sharp whack of the rolling pin.\nTurn the pastry by 90 degrees (a quarter turn) and fold the bottom third of the pastry up, then the top third down. Roll the pastry out towards the folded edges until it measures roughly 60x25cm/23x10in, then fold the pastry in by thirds again. Give the pastry a further two turns. Wrap the pastry in cling film and transfer to the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.\nTo cook the pie, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.\nPut the beef and gravy mixture in a 23cm/9in diameter round ovenproof dish. Roll out the pastry to 1cm/\u2153in thickness and cut the pastry into a circle slightly bigger than the pie dish. Brush a little water around the rim of the pie dish, then place the pastry over the filling and press the edges to seal the pastry to the dish. Brush the pie with a little beaten egg, put the pie in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the pastry is pale golden-brown and has risen.\nMeanwhile, for the mashed potatoes boil the potatoes in salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and put the potatoes back in the saucepan over the heat to remove excess moisture. Mash the potatoes. Heat the butter and cream in a saucepan until the butter is melted. Add to the mash and beat well until soft and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.\nBoil the peas for 2-3 minutes and then drain.\nTo serve, put a spoonful of the pie on each plate with the mash and peas alongside.",

Alternatively, use a food processor to blend the ingredients together.\nTurn out the tortellini dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly for 2-3 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Cut the chilled pasta dough into quarters. Roll out one quarter of the dough onto a lightly floured work surface until very thin. This can be done using a rolling pin or a pasta machine. If using a pasta machine, dust the rollers and set them to their widest setting, then pass the pasta dough through the machine, collecting the rolled pasta at the other end. Keep rolling the pasta sheet through the machine, reducing the rollers to their next-widest setting each time, until the pasta has been rolled through the rollers set to their narrowest setting.\nRoll out another quarter of the pasta dough in the same way.\nLay one pasta sheet onto a lightly floured work surface. Spoon teaspoonfuls of the p\u00e2t\u00e9 at 5cm/2in intervals down one half of the pasta sheet, then spoon another row of p\u00e2t\u00e9 portions down the other half to create 2 rows.\nBrush the exposed parts of the pasta sheet with the beaten egg, then carefully place the second pasta sheet on top and press down around the p\u00e2t\u00e9 filling to seal, pushing out any air bubbles as you go.\nUsing a cookie cutter, cut discs from the pasta so that the tortellini filling is in the centre of each circle with a 0.5cm/\u00bcin border around it.\nCarefully fold the filled pasta discs in half, then twist each end and bring the points over the filling until they meet, so that the filled pasta forms a ring shape.\nRepeat the whole process until all of the p\u00e2t\u00e9 has been used up and all of the pasta shapes have been turned into tortellini. The remaining unrolled pasta can be frozen for use in another recipe (see tip).\nBall the carrot and the courgette using a melon baller, parisienne scoop or similar (alternatively, dice the carrot and courgette).\nBring a saucepan of water to a simmer and lower the tortellini and carrot and courgette balls into the water. Simmer for 1-2 minutes, then remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and divide equally among serving bowls. Ladle the consomm\u00e9 into the bowls and serve immediately.",

Let them sizzle for five seconds, then add the onion, cooked potatoes and chillies.\nLower the heat to medium and stir-fry the mixture for 4-5 minutes, or until the onion has softened and is translucent. Add the beef, salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper, then stir-fry for a further minute.\nReduce the heat to medium-low. Press down on all the ingredients in the pan with a spatula to form a flat cake that fills the pan. Continue to cook for 12-15 minutes, turning the pan so that the bottom of the \u2018cake\u2019 browns evenly. Keep warm.\nFor the karhai broccoli, heat the oil in a karhai (or lidded wok or frying pan) over a medium-high heat.\nWhen the oil is hot, add the asafoetida, cumin and mustard seeds (be aware of mustard seeds popping out of the pan into your eyes). As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop, add the broccoli. Stir-fry for one minute, then add the salt and cayenne pepper.\nPour in four tablespoons of water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pan with a lid, lower the heat until the mixture is simmering gently and cook for 7-8 minutes, or until the broccoli is just tender, stirring now and then.\nMeanwhile, for the sweet-and-sour butternut squash, heat the oil in a lidded pan over a medium heat. When hot, add the asafoetida and mustard seeds. As soon as the seeds start to pop - a matter of seconds - add the squash.\nStir-fry the squash for 2-3 minutes, or until the pieces just start to brown. Add 50ml/2fl oz water, cover the pan with a lid, lower the heat and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the squash is tender.\nAdd the salt, sugar, cayenne pepper and yoghurt. Stir until well combined and cook, uncovered, over a medium heat, until the yoghurt mixture has warmed through. Stir in the fresh coriander.\nTo serve, break up the the beef jhal faraizi into four equal portions and serve it hot with the karahi broccoli and squash.",

Upturn a dinner plate onto the pastry and cut round it using a sharp knife to create a large pastry disc. Find a bowl that is about 3cm/1\u00bcin smaller in diameter than the pastry disc, then upturn it in the centre and use it as a template to score a smaller circle on the pastry. Transfer the pastry disc to the prepared baking tray.\nPrick the inner pastry circle several times with a fork. Spread over some of the mustard, then arrange some of the cooked beef on top, then spread some of the vegetable mixture on top of that, always keeping inside the scored circle.\nSpoon alternate layers of the mustard, beef, and vegetable mixture in the centre of the pastry disc until everything is used up.\nBrush the pastry border with some of the beaten egg.\nRoll out the second piece of pastry onto a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of about 5mm/\u00bcin. Lay the pastry over the top of the dome of filling, pressing down gently around the edges to seal the two pieces of pastry together.\nTrim away any excess pastry. Use any offcuts to decorate the top of the pithivier with a flower shape. Use a butter knife to score details into the petals and stem, if desired.\nBrush the surface of the pithivier all over with the remaining beaten egg. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the filling is piping hot and the pastry is crisp and golden-brown.\nServe the pithivier with the remaining leftover gravy.",

Alternatively, blend the flour and eggs in a food processor until the mixture forms small crumbs. Tip it out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface and squish into a ball, then knead for a few minutes until smooth.\nWrap the pasta dough in cling film and chill for 20 minutes in the fridge.\nDust the rollers of your pasta-rolling machine with flour.\nCut the chilled pasta dough into 3 equally sized pieces and flatten them with the palms of your hand to a thickness of 1cm/\u00bdin.\nStarting at the lowest (thickest) setting, feed the dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand and holding the dough as it comes through the machine with the other.\nChange the setting on the pasta machine to the next-thickest setting, flour it again and feed the pasta sheet through the machine again, as before.\nRepeat this process 3 or 4 more times, flouring the machine and changing the setting down each time until the last but one setting. You should end up with a long sheet of pasta.\nRepeat the rolling process with the remaining pieces of pasta dough.\nFold the rolled pasta sheets over into a manageable size, then cut them lengthways to form strips of linguine about 3mm thick. Hang the linguine over a rack so that it can dry out slightly while you make the ragu.\nFor the ragu, heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole over a medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until softened but not coloured.\nAdd the carrot and celery and fry for another 2-3 minutes. Add the bacon and fry for a further 1-2 minutes.\nAdd the beef mince and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until just browned.\nStir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, then pour in the tinned tomatoes and red wine and bring the mixture to the boil.\nStir in half of the basil leaves, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Simmer for 45 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the remaining basil leaves just before serving.\nTo serve, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until tender. Drain well, then add the pasta to the pan of ragu and mix well to coat the pasta in the sauce. Serve sprinkled with the Parmesan.",

Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and balsamic and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Return the meat to the pan and stir in the rest of the stock, then bring to the boil.\nPut the dish in the oven (without a lid) and cook for 1 hour.\nAdd the parsnip, butternut squash and carrot chunks, put the lid on the dish and cook for another 30 minutes.\nFor the dumplings, put the flour in a mixing bowl with the salt and pepper. Mix in the herbs. Add the egg and oil and mix, adding just enough cold water to bring it together as a dough (about 4 tbsp). Be careful not to add too much water as this will make the dumplings heavy. Knead the mixture a little.\nShape into eight golf-ball-sized pieces and put on top of the stew, pushing down a little to coat in the juices. Cover with the lid and return to the oven for 15 minutes, then remove the lid and cook for a further 15 minutes.\nWhen the dumplings are golden-brown, lift them out of the stew into serving bowls and stir the stew (the squash will be very tender, which will thicken and flavour the sauce). Serve immediately.",

            "instructions": "For the mushroom duxelle, heat the butter and vegetable oil in a frying pan. Once hot, add the chopped shallots and fry, stirring all the time, for two minutes. Tip in the chopped mushrooms. Reduce the heat a little and continue stirring and cooking for about ten minutes until the mushrooms are softened and their liquid has evaporated. Stir in the cream and cook for a further two minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to cool.\nFor the Wellington, heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Season the fillet all over with salt and pepper. Once the oil is smoking, add the beef and fry on all sides until it is a lovely caramel-brown colour. Remove to a plate and leave to cool. (NB. Don\u2019t wash up the pan. Use this to make the Madeira and port reduction later.)\nPlace the cr\u00eapes onto the work surface, one layer thick, but overlapping - you need to create an area about twice the thickness of the fillet, and about 2.5cm/1in longer at each end. Spread the mushroom duxelle over the cr\u00eapes.\nLightly pat the fillet with kitchen paper to remove any excess moisture, before placing the meat on top of the duxelle.\nCarefully roll the side closest to you over the meat encasing it within the cr\u00eapes and mushrooms. The cr\u00eapes should cover the meat on all sides, but trim off any excess.\nPlace the wrapped fillet onto a sheet of clingfilm and wrap up tightly into a cylinder. Set aside in the fridge until completely cold, about half an hour.\nMeanwhile for the potato dauphinoise, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.\nRub the inside of a deep baking dish or casserole with the raw garlic.\nPlace the sliced potatoes in a bowl and pour over the cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir to coat the potatoes, then lay them evenly in the garlicky baking dish.\nCover the dish with foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for a further 20-30 minutes while you prepare the Wellington.\nRoll the pastry out on a well-floured surface to a rectangle with a thickness of about 3mm.\nBrush the pastry with beaten egg yolk. Remove the clingfilm from the beef fillet and place onto the middle of the pastry.\nWrap the pastry up over the beef fillet. Lightly stretch one edge of the seam so that it is not too thick, then press down firmly to seal.\nYou should be left with a tube that is open at either end. Lightly press the ends of the pastry together using a rolling pin to seal and thin the two pieces. Then with a small knife, trim the edges on each side to form a triangle shape. Brush the triangle of pastry with a little egg and press it up against the side of the Wellington. Repeat with the other side before flipping over so that the Wellington is seam-side down.\nPlace your Wellington onto a baking tray, brush with the remaining egg yolk set aside in the fridge to chill for 5-10 minutes.\nIncrease the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4 (the dauphinoise should remain in the oven).\nRemove the Wellington from the fridge and score a pattern of your choice onto the top.\nPlace in the oven with the potatoes dauphinoise and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the Wellington from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes. This should give you a perfectly pink finish to your meat. If you prefer it more cooked, then leave in the oven for longer, but you must ensure the meat is well rested.\nFor the Madeira and port reduction, heat the butter in the same pan in which you cooked the beef fillet over a medium heat. Once bubbling, add the shallot and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.\nIncrease the heat and add the port and Madeira. Simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half and then add the stock. Reduce again by half. When the sauce has a thick, syrupy consistency, strain through a fine sieve. Stir in the truffle peelings and keep warm until ready to serve.\nServe slices of the beef Wellington with the potato dauphinoise alongside and the Madeira and port reduction.",

Quickly fry the beef fillet, turning it every few seconds, until browned on all sides.\nCut 4 large pieces of heatproof cling film or aluminium foil big enough to roll the beef fillet in, and place them on top of each other. Place the beef fillet in the centre and wrap it very tightly to form a cylinder, twisting the ends to secure. Place the wrapped beef fillet on a baking tray and roast in the oven for an hour.\nRemove the beef from the oven, set aside until cooled to room temperature, then chill in the fridge until completely cold.\nMeanwhile, heat a knob of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the chopped mushrooms and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until all of the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms have softened. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and wipe the pan with a piece of kitchen roll.\nAdd a little more butter to the pan, then fry the spinach for a minute, or until just starting to wilt. Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir the spinach until completely wilted. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\nNext, make the pancakes. Place the two whole eggs and the flour in a bowl and whisk together until well combined. Gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture forms a smooth batter that is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nHeat a knob of butter in a frying over a high heat. When the butter is foaming and starting to smoke, add a ladleful of the pancake batter and swirl the pan to evenly coat the base. Fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the underside of the pancake is golden-brown. Flip the pancake over and cook for a further minute, or until the pancake is cooked through and golden-brown all over. Slide the pancake out onto a plate lined with greaseproof paper, then cover it with another layer of greaseproof paper. Repeat the process with the remaining butter and pancake batter.\nPlace the chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 in a bowl and beat until smooth and soft.\nIncrease the oven temperature to 230C/210C Fan/Gas 8.\nRoll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle measuring 40x50cm/16x20in with a thickness of 2-3mm (it needs to be large enough to wrap the beef fillet).\nArrange the pancakes all over the pastry, overlapping the edges slightly and leaving a 2.5cm/1in border free at the edge. Trim the overlapping edges of the pancakes using a sharp knife so they sit in one even layer.\nSpread the softened p\u00e2t\u00e9 in an even layer all over the pancakes. Arrange a layer of wilted spinach on top. Spread the cooked mushrooms on top of the spinach. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Finally, peel the cling film or foil from the beef fillet and place it in the centre.\nWhisk the egg yolks in a bowl, then brush them around the pastry border. Tightly roll the beef fillet in the pastry, ensuring the seal sits at the bottom of the Wellington. Tuck the ends underneath the Wellington without trimming them. Transfer the Wellington to a baking tray lined with baking paper and brush all over with the remaining beaten egg yolks. If desired, decorate with pastry trimmings.\nBake the beef Wellington in the oven for 20-25 minutes (for medium), or until the pastry has risen and is golden-brown.\nMeanwhile, heat a knob of butter in a frying pan over a high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the wild mushrooms and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until just softened. Add the Madeira and set it alight using a match. (Caution: Keep eyes and hair away from the flames and switch off the extractor fan before flaming.) Allow the flames to flare up and die down.\nAdd the concentrated beef stock and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Continue to simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the volume of liquid has reduced by one-third.

Wrap the folded pastry in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.\nRemove the pastry from the fridge and unwrap it. Repeat the rolling out and folding process another two times, turning the pastry by a quarter each time. After folding it for the last time, wrap again in cling film and chill in the fridge until needed.\nFor the pie filling, place the beef, garlic, thyme, peppercorns and ale into a bowl. Cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours, but preferably overnight.\nRemove the beef from the marinade, pat dry with kitchen paper and dredge in the seasoned flour. Strain the marinade through a fine sieve into a clean bowl and set aside.\nHeat the oil and one tablespoon of the butter in a flameproof casserole dish and fry the beef in small batches for 2-3 minutes each time, or until browned all over. Once the meat is browned, remove from the casserole dish and set aside.\nReturn the casserole dish to the heat and fry the mushrooms and shallots for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.\nReturn the beef and the reserved marinating liquid to the casserole and add the beef stock. Cover with a lid and gently simmer for 1\u00bd hours, or until the beef is tender.\nStrain off half of the cooking liquid from the casserole dish and set aside to make gravy for serving.\nCrumble the Stilton into the casserole and stir until melted. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease four 10cm/4in chefs' rings and dust each with flour.\nPlace the chefs' rings onto a baking tray and fill each with the beef and Stilton filling.\nOn a floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of about 2.5cm/1in. Cut out four circles of pastry large enough to cover the chefs' rings with a bit of overhang.\nBrush the edges of the pastry with some of the beaten egg and place over the chefs' rings. Crimp the pastry to seal, then trim off any excess pastry, making sure there are no gaps between the chefs' rings and the pastry. Make a small hole in the middle of each pastry lid so allow steam to escape, then brush all over with the remaining beaten egg.\nBake the pies in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown.\nMeanwhile, place the reserved cooking liquid into a clean pan and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until reduced to a gravy consistency. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter until melted, and the sauce is smooth and glossy. Keep warm.\nFor the celeriac and mustard mash, place the celeriac and potatoes into separate pans of cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook the celeriac for 15-20 minutes and the potatoes for 10-12 minutes, or until both are tender. Drain well, then place both the celeriac and potatoes to one pan and place back over the heat for a few minutes to drive off any excess moisture.\nMash the celeriac and potatoes together, then beat in the butter, the cream and the mustard until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and white pepper.\nFor the honey-roasted beetroot, preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.\nMix together the thyme, vinegar, olive oil and honey in a bowl until well combined.\nUsing a small melon baller or small spoon, scoop out balls of the beetroot and place into the bowl with the honey mixture and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPlace the beetroot into a deep roasting tray and roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the beetroot is sticky and glazed.\nTo serve, transfer the pies onto a serving plate using a fish slice or spatula. Carefully remove the chefs' rings. Spoon the celeriac and potato mash on the side. Spoon the honey-roasted beetroot balls alongside and serve with a small jug of the gravy.",

Allow to drip dry Heat the oil in heavy-based saucepan that has a tight fitting lid.\nAdd the spices and fry for a minute.\nAdd the rice and fry until the grains begin to turn an opaque white.\nAdd the water and a good pinch of salt.\nBring to the boil then allow to bubble away until nearly all the water has been absorbed and air holes are beginning to appear.\nAt this point pop the lid on. Leave the heat on underneath for a minute (this will create lots of steam) then allow to stand for five minutes (do not remove the lid).\nKeep warm until everything else is ready. You can hold rice like this for up to half an hour.\nTo serve, mix the herbs into the rice and divide between four warmed serving dishes. Next spoon on the rendang, finish with a few sprigs of coriander and serve immediately, garnished with the deep-fried shallots and chilli.",

Add the bacon and fry for 6-8 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.\nSprinkle the flour onto a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Dredge the cubes of beef in the seasoned flour until coated.\nAdd the coated beef cubes to the pan with the bacon in it and fry for 4-5 minutes, turning regularly, until browned.\nAdd the onions and continue to fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened but not coloured.\nAdd the wine, stock, bouquet garni, Worcestershire sauce and brandy and stir to combine. Cover the pan with a lid and bring the mixture to a simmer. Continue to simmer until the meat is tender and falling apart (about two hours if using braising steak, or three hours if using shin).\nWhen the meat is tender, increase the heat and bring the cooking liquid to the boil. Continue to cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the volume of liquid has reduced by about half. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.\nMeanwhile, for the suet puddings, grease eight small pudding basins with butter.\nIn a bowl, mix together the flour, suet, thyme, sage and salt until well combined.\nGradually add just enough water until the mixture comes together as a firm dough (you may not need to use all of the water).\nAdd the egg yolk and knead it into the dough until well combined. Cover the bowl and chill the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.\nWhen the dough has chilled, pinch off eight equal portions of the dough.\nRoll the first portion of dough into a ball and pinch off about a quarter of it. Roll the larger ball of dough out onto a lightly floured work surface into a large thin circle (set the smaller portion aside).\nLine one of the prepared pudding basins with the suet pastry disc.\nFill the lined pudding basin with some of the beef and red wine sauce until it is three-quarters full.\nRoll out the smaller portion of suet pastry onto a lightly floured work surface until it is just larger than the top of the pudding basin.\nBrush the rim of the lined pudding basin with a little of the beaten egg. Cover the pudding basin with this pastry 'lid', pressing the edges of the pastry together to seal. Trim off any excess.\nBrush the pastry 'lid' all over with a little more of the beaten egg.\nRepeat the process with the remaining suet pastry and filling mixture until you have prepared eight individual puddings and all of the beef has been used up (reserve any leftover red wine sauce).\nWrap each pudding basin tightly in two sheets of aluminium foil.\nPrepare a steamer large enough to hold all of the pudding basins (alternatively, cook the puddings in batches). Steam the puddings for 25-30 minutes, or until cooked through.\nMeanwhile, for the parmentier potatoes, boil the potatoes, whole and in their skins, in a large pan of salted water for 18-20 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and set aside to cool. Once cool, peel away the skins and cut the potatoes into 1cm/\u00bdin cubes. Set aside to cool, then chill in the fridge.\nHeat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the cold diced potatoes and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown on all sides. Remove from the heat and set aside.\nMeanwhile, for the kidneys, heat one tablespoon of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, celery and carrot and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.\nAdd the garlic and thyme and fry for a further 1-2 minutes.\nIn a separate frying pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over a medium heat. Add the kidneys and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until just browned.\nAdd the browned kidneys to the pan with the vegetables in it.\nAdd the sherry to the pan the kidneys were cooked in and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon to deglaze. Add the sherry and pan juices to the vegetables and kidneys and stir well to combine. Continue to cook for a further 1-2 minutes.\nStir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and heat through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the parsley. Keep warm.\nFor the cauliflower cheese, boil the cauliflower florets in a pan for 4-5 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and pat dry with kitchen paper.\nTransfer the cauliflower florets to a food processor. Add the cream and blend to a pur\u00e9e. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nReturn the mixture to a clean pan and warm over a low heat. Stir in the cheese until melted.\nFor the peas, boil the peas in a pan of boiling water until tender. Drain well and return the peas to the pan. Stir in the oregano and butter. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Crush lightly with a potato masher. Set aside and keep warm.\nJust before serving, heat the remaining red wine sauce in a pan until warmed through.\nStrain the sauce through a fine sieve. Add a knob of butter to the strained liquid and stir until melted.\nTo serve, unwrap one beef suet pudding and turn it out of its mould and onto a serving plate. Spoon some of the kidneys alongside. Press a portion of the crushed peas into a chefs' ring and remove the ring. Spoon the cauliflower cheese pur\u00e9e and parmentier potatoes alongside. Drizzle over the red wine sauce.",

Give it a quarter-turn.\nRoll the block of pastry into a 40x20cm/16x8in rectangle as before, and fold it into three again. These are the first two turns. Wrap the block in cling film and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.\nGive the chilled pastry another two turns, rolling and folding as before. This makes a total of four turns. Wrap the pastry in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.\nFor the pancakes, place the eggs and flour into a bowl and whisk together.\nGradually add the milk, whisking constantly, to create a smooth batter that will coat the back of a spoon.\nHeat a frying pan over a high heat and add the butter. When the butter is foaming, add a ladleful of the pancake batter and swirl the pan to evenly coat the base. Fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the underside is golden-brown. Carefully flip the pancake over and cook for a further minute, or until the pancake is cooked through and golden-brown all over. Slide the pancake out onto a plate lined with greaseproof paper, then cover with another layer of paper. Repeat with the remaining pancake batter to make another pancake.\nFor the duxelle, heat the butter in the frying pan until foaming, then add the mushrooms and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the mushrooms are golden-brown. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then set aside to cool.\nFor the beef Wellington, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.\nSeason the beef fillet with black pepper then place into a frying pan over a high heat. Turn the fillet to ensure even cooking. Remove when browned on each side and leave to rest in a warm place.\nRoll out the puff pastry until 5mm/\u00bcin thick. Take two pancakes and place into the centre of the pastry, and cover with a layer of chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, then a layer of the cooked mushrooms, then a layer of spinach on top.\nBeat the beaten egg and egg yolk together in a bowl, then brush the egg over the clear area of the pancakes and pastry and fold the pastry around to enclose the beef. Press the open ends together to seal the pastry covering and make it a close fit to the beef. Trim off any excess pastry.\nPlace the beef Wellington seam-side down onto a baking tray lined with baking parchment and brush with the beaten egg. Place in the fridge to cool for 30 minutes.\nRemove from the fridge and brush with egg once more.\nPlace into the oven and bake for 25 minutes (if you do not like your beef rare cook for 30-35 minutes for medium), or until the pastry is golden-brown, then remove and leave to rest on a serving plate for 15 minutes.\nFor the purple sprouting broccoli and jus, place a large pan of boiling water on the hob. Once boiling, place the broccoli in the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes.\nDrain the broccoli and heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the broccoli and cook for 2-3 minutes.\nPlace the stock in a pan and boil to reduce in volume by half. Add the red wine and reduce again to half the volume.\nTo serve, cut the Wellington into portions and place on a plate serve with the broccoli and jus.",

Season the steaks with salt, then add to the pan to cook for 1-2 minutes. Turn once to brown both sides (don't move the steaks around once they are in the pan or the peppercorn crust will fall off - cook to achieve a good crusty coating on each side.)\nAdd the butter and allow it melt and turn nut-brown in colour, but don't let it burn.\nAdd the mushrooms and stir in the butter. As the mushrooms start to absorb the pan juices, turn the steaks again and allow them to cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.\nRemove the steaks and place onto a baking tray and leave to rest in a warm place.\nFor the tatties, place the potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and gently crush each potato with a fork until it just splits. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground white pepper, and add the parsley. Mix until all the butter has been absorbed, but don't over-mash the potatoes.\nFor the spinach, heat a medium frying pan or wok until hot. Add the butter and the spinach and stir-fry for one minute, then add the water. Continue to stir until the spinach has wilted. Remove from the heat, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground white pepper and set aside until ready to serve.\nFor the whisky sauce, add the whisky to the pan used to cook the steaks, and cook over a very high heat for one minute to boil off the alcohol. (CAUTION: the whisky may catch fire, which is perfectly acceptable, but if this worries you, have a large lid handy to place onto the pan to prevent the flames. And make sure you have your extractor fan turned off.)\nAdd the stock and boil to reduce the liquid volume, until thickened, then add the cream. Boil to reduce the liquid volume again, scraping and stirring to loosen the stuck bits from the bottom of the pan.\nPour any juices released by the resting steaks into the sauce and stir well.\nTo serve, place a chefs' ring into the centre of each of four plates. Fill with the crushed potatoes and carefully remove the ring. Place a small pile of spinach onto the potatoes, and arrange two medallions of steak on top of each pile. Spoon the sauce and the mushrooms over the steak, and serve.",

Transfer the pork loin rack to a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, blend the brioche, English mustard powder and soaked yellow and brown mustard seeds to a paste in a food processor with the remaining butter. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then set aside.\nFor the gratin, arrange half of the Swiss chard in a layer at the bottom of an ovenproof dish and top with half the potatoes. Sprinkle over the onion, then top with layers of the remaining Swiss chard and potatoes.\nMelt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the flour and whisk well to combine with the melted butter. Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, whisking regularly, then gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously, until all of the milk has been incorporated and the mixture has thickened to a smooth sauce.\nWhisk in the stock and half of the Gruy\u00e8re and stir until melted. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPour the sauce all over the chard and potatoes. Sprinkle over the remaining Gruy\u00e8re.\nAfter the pork has been cooking for 15 minutes, remove it from the oven and decrease the temperature to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.\nSpread the brioche and mustard paste all over the top of the pork loin rack in a thick layer, then return the pork to the oven, along with the Swiss-chard gratin. Cook both for a further 45 minutes, or until the pork is cooked to your liking and the crumb has crisped up and turned golden-brown, and the Swiss-chard gratin is bubbling and golden-brown.\nWhen the pork is cooked to your liking, set it aside to rest for 15 minutes (keep warm). Continue cooking the Swiss-chard gratin for a further 15 minutes, if necessary; otherwise, keep warm.\nTo serve, carve the pork loin rack into six chops.

Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in the egg mix. Using a table knife, work the liquid into the flour to bring the pastry together. If it seems too dry, add a splash more water.

Line a 23cm/9in tart tin with the pastry, leaving any excess pastry hanging over the edge. Reserve a little uncooked pastry in case you need to patch any cracks later.\nLine the pastry case with baking parchment or foil, then fill with baking beans, or uncooked rice or lentils. Bake blind for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment and baking beans and return to the oven for about eight minutes or until the pastry looks dry and faintly coloured. Using a small, sharp knife, trim away the excess pastry from the edge. Use a tiny bit of the reserved raw pastry to patch any cracks or holes if necessary.\nTurn the oven down to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\nFor the filling, if you\u2019re using pre-packed beetroot, drain away any excess liquid. Roughly chop the beetroot and put into a food processor with the cream. Blend to a thick pur\u00e9e.\nIn a bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together thoroughly.

Set aside to cool.\nOn a floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to a 3mm/\u215bin thickness. Pay attention to the size of it as you are rolling: it will have to cover the beetroots in the pan.

Check that the bottom of the bowl isn\u2019t touching the water. When the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat and stir until smooth, then set aside to cool for a few minutes.\nTo make the base, break up the biscuits roughly, then put them in a food processor and blitz them into crumbs.

Pop the tin into the freezer to harden.\nPreheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/Fan 160\u00b0C/Gas 4. Bring a kettle of water to the boil.\nPut the cheese, soured cream, sugar and eggs in a food processor and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the melted chocolate and blend until thoroughly combined.\nRemove the biscuit base from the freezer. Take two large sheets of foil and place them on the work surface, one across the other. Put the tin in the centre of the foil and bring the foil up around it to create a bowl shape. Place the whole thing in a roasting tin. Pour the chocolate mixture on to the biscuit base. Carefully pour hot water from the kettle into the roasting tin until it rises almost halfway up the sides of the cheesecake.\nBake the cheesecake in the centre of the oven for 35\u201345 minutes. It\u2019s ready when the chocolate mixture is almost firm but retains a slight wobble.\nTurn the oven off, but wedge a folded tea towel in the door and leave the cake to cool in the oven with the door ajar for at least 1 hour. Remove, cover with cling film and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.\nTo serve, loosen the sides of the tin with a knife and release the spring clip. Slide the dessert off the base of the tin on to a plate. Decorate with the chocolate truffles and dust with grated white chocolate or icing sugar. For utter luxury, serve with some cream.",

Leave for at least six hours, but preferably overnight.\nFor the casserole, drain the meat, reserving the liquid and the rest of the marinade ingredients. Pat the meat dry and brush off any garlic.\nHeat half of the olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the meat in batches until well browned. Deglaze the base of the frying pan with a little of the marinade liquid and set aside.\nIn a large casserole, add the remaining olive oil. Add the lardons and fry on a high heat for a few minutes until crisp and brown. Add the onion and reduce the heat to medium. Fry for around 10 minutes, or until the onion has softened and lightly coloured. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e. Add the beef to the casserole and stir to coat.\nStrain the marinade and pour over the liquid along with the deglazing liquid from the frying pan and the second bouquet garni.\nBring to the boil and simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by around a third.\nAdd enough beef stock so that the beef is just covered. Return to the boil, then turn down the heat to low. Cover, and simmer for around three hours.\nIf you are able to, leave overnight \u2013 cool and leave in the fridge to chill. Once chilled, it will make skimming off any fat much easier. Otherwise, just skim off some of the fat which will collect at the top.\nAdd the olives, then simmer uncovered for a further hour to reduce down the sauce. Serve with red camargue rice.",

Fold the rest lightly into the cream and spoon gently on top.\nPeel and slice the remaining banana and put it in a bowl. Pour the lemon juice over and gently toss (this will stop the banana turning brown). Decorate the top with the lemony banana, poking into the cream randomly, and sprinkle the pie with grated chocolate or decorate with chocolate curls. Serve in fairly thin slices as it is very rich.",

Beat hard with a wooden spoon until smooth. Leave to cool for 10 minutes.

You want the chunks to be around 1.5cm/\u00bein. Break the pecan nuts or walnuts in half. Stir the chocolate pieces, cherries and nuts into the cake batter. Pour into the prepared tin and spread to all the corners with a rubber spatula or the back of a spoon.\nBake the brownie in the centre of the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the mixture is crusty on the surface and lightly cooked inside. Do not allow it to overcook as the cake will become spongy rather than gooey in the centre.\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool for 5-10 minutes. Take out of the tin and transfer to a board. Cut into squares or rectangles to serve warm or leave to cool completely if serving cold. This brownie should keep well for 3-4 days if well wrapped with foil \u2013 but we doubt it will last that long!",

Set aside to cool.\nBring a little water to the boil in a pan. Reduce the heat until the water is simmering, then suspend a heatproof bowl over the water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water.\nAdd the chocolate to the bowl and stir until just melted. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.\nDrizzle the honey over the toasted oats. Add the honey-coated oats to the melted chocolate and stir well.\nAdd the remaining almond liqueur and one-third of the double cream to the chocolate mixture and stir until well combined.\nWhip the remaining cream in a bowl with the icing sugar until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.\nDivide the chocolate-and-oat mixture among four tumblers or individual trifle dishes.\nNext, spoon some of the whipped cream into each dish. Layer in the macerated cherries (saving four to use as a garnish).\nSpoon in the remaining whipped cream, then sprinkle over the toasted almonds.\nChill the Black Forest cranachans in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or until needed, to firm up.\nJust before serving, garnish each dessert with one of the remaining cherries.",

Grease 2 x 20cm/8 in loose-based sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.\nPut the butter, sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and eggs into a food processor and blend until smooth and thick. You may need push the mixture down from the sides a couple of times to make sure the mixture is well blended.\nDivide the batter between the prepared cake tins and spread it out evenly with a rubber spatula.\nBake for 22\u201325 minutes or until the cakes are nicely risen and just beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tins. Remove them from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before turning out on to a wire rack. Take off the lining paper and leave the cakes to cool.\nWhen the cakes are cold, cut them in half, horizontally, with a long-bladed serrated knife. Take care to keep the knife parallel to the work surface, to get a good even cut. Place the cakes back on the wire rack or a board, cut sides up.\nFor the filling, put the jam in a saucepan with the sour cherries and Kirsch and place over a low heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 6\u20138 minutes, stirring, until the jam has melted and the cherries are beginning to swell. Leave to cool for 15 minutes.\nSprinkle the cherry brandy over the chocolate sponges, then spread three of them with the sour cherry mixture and leave to cool. Make sure that the sponge without the cherry topping is from the top half of a cake.\nWhip 300ml/10fl oz of the cream with an electric hand-whisk until soft peaks form.\nTransfer one of the sponges (with the cherry topping) very carefully to a cake stand or plate \u2013 slide a cake tin base under the sponge to help you. Using a couple of pudding spoons, dollop about a third of the whipped cream gently on top of the cherry mixture. There is no need to spread it out, but try to keep the spoonfuls evenly spaced over the cake. Sprinkle with a little of the grated chocolate.\nTop with another sponge and repeat the layers twice more. You should end up with three layers of sponge, cherries, cream and chocolate. Place the final sponge on top, with its top surface facing upwards.\nWhip the remaining 200ml/8fl oz of the cream with an electric hand-whisk until soft peaks form.\nUsing the flat side of a palette knife, spread about three tablespoons of the cream over the top of the cake, taking it all the way to the edge. Spoon the remaining cream into a piping bag fitted with a large, plain nozzle and pipe rosettes around the edge of the cake. Tip almost all the remaining grated chocolate into the centre and sprinkle the rest over the rosettes.\nDecorate with fresh cherries if you have some. Keep the cake cool or chill until ready to serve.\nIt\u2019s best to eat it the same day as it is made \u2013 how could you resist? \u2013 but if you need to make the cake in advance, chill it in the fridge for up to 24 hours and allow to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.",

Heat the granulated sugar and 50ml/2fl oz water in a small pan over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring and bring the mixture to the boil with the sugar thermometer submerged. Once the syrup reaches 112C, start the stand mixer on a high speed. When the syrup reaches 118C the egg whites should be foamy and white. Carefully pour the boiling syrup down the side of the mixing bowl with the stand mixer running (CAUTION: Sugar syrup is very hot. Do not pour the syrup onto the beaters or it may splash back at you.). Keep whisking the meringue until the outside of the bowl is cool to the touch.\nUsing a soft spatula, mix half the meringue into the almond mixture \u2013 don\u2019t worry about being too gentle. Once the colour is uniform, add the remaining meringue.\nSpoon the mixture into a large piping bag and cut a 1cm/1/2in diameter hole in the tip. Pipe 3cm/1\u00bcin discs onto the prepared baking trays and leave at room temperature for at least half an hour before baking. This allows a skin to form, which helps achieve a good dome.\nPreheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3.

Remove the macaroons from the oven and leave to cool on their trays.\nMeanwhile, make the ganache. Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a saucepan until it starts to steam (but before boiling). Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave for a minute. Gently stir until the chocolate melts and the ganache becomes glossy. Add the kirsch, if using, and stir. Set aside to firm-up to a piping consistency.\nTransfer the ganache to a small piping bag and cut a small hole in the tip. Place a blob of cherry jam in the centre of each shell and pipe a ring of ganache around it. Place the other half-shell on top and squeeze gently until the ganache reaches the edge.

(Make sure the yeast and salt do not touch.)\nAdd approximately half the milk mixture and, using the dough hook attachment, mix slowly to bring the mixture together. Keep adding the milk mixture until all the flour is incorporated (you may not need all the milk). Increase the mixer speed to medium and mix for three minutes.\nSlowly add the butter until incorporated and mix for a further six minutes. The dough should be smooth and elastic.\nGrease a large bowl with rapeseed oil and add the dough. Cover with a shower cap or greased cling film. Prove the dough in a warm place (ideally 27C/80F) for 50 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.\nWhen the dough has proved, tip it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knock back the dough and fold over on itself a couple of times.\nFor the filling, gently knead in the cherries and chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Divide the dough into 80g/2\u00beoz portions and roll into balls.\nFlatten the dough balls slightly and place half a sugar cube in the centre of each ball. Soak each sugar cube with some cherry brandy, using a pipette if available. Pull the dough over the sugar cubes, to seal the cube in the centre. Roll into neat balls.\nLine two large baking trays with non-stick baking parchment. Place the dough balls on the baking tray leaving a 1cm/\u00bdin gap between the balls to allow for expansion. Spray with a fine mist of water (if you don\u2019t have a spray bottle, wet your hands and flick droplets of water onto the buns). Prove for another 25 minutes in a warm place (ideally 27C/80F).\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and place a rack on the third shelf (just below the centre).\nFor the decoration, after proving, gently brush the buns all over with egg wash. Place a glace cherry on top of each bun and decorate with nibbed sugar. Using a small sieve, dust the buns with ground cinnamon.\nBake for around 25\u201330 minutes, or until well risen and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool.\nMeanwhile, melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water). Spoon the chocolate into a piping bag fitted with a fine writing nozzle.\nWhen cooled, drizzle the melted chocolate over the buns to decorate. Serve once the chocolate is set.",

If using a food processor, blend to this consistency. Drizzle in the egg yolk and use a knife to mix through till the crumb starts to come together. (If using a food processor blend the egg into the mix for a few seconds till the crumb combines.) If the mixture is too dry you can add small amounts of egg white to the bowl or processor and blend till the crumb comes together.\nForm the pastry into a block and chill in a fridge for 20 minutes until hard.\nGrease a 25cm/10in tart tin then dust it with flour.\nUsing a rough edged grater grate the cold pastry into the tart tin. Push the pastry into the corners then grate more pastry and firm down onto the base of the tin until about 6mm/\u00bcin deep. Place in the fridge for approximately 20 minutes while you make the pastry cream.\nTo make the pastry cream, place the egg yolks and caster sugar in a bowl. Whisk until thick and pale in colour then stir in the flour and corn flour.\nPlace the milk in a saucepan, add a pinch of salt. Score the vanilla pod down the length with a knife and add it to the milk and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave the mixture to infuse for 10 minutes.\nRemove the vanilla pod and return the milk to the heat. Bring to the boil and then slowly add the hot milk to the egg mixture whisking all the time. Pour the mixture back into the pan and reduce the heat to low. Whisk constantly and bring to the boil again. After around two minutes the mixture should thicken. Pour into a cold bowl to stop the cooking process.\nWhisk the cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed, and then fold it into the pastry cream. Add the whisky to the mixture and chill it in the fridge.\nTo blind bake the pastry, Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Remove the pastry and tart tin from the fridge. Cut a piece of greaseproof paper or baking parchment that is larger than the tin and scrunch into a ball and open out again so that it\u2019s soft and less rigid. Place the paper into the pastry case and gently fill with dried pulses or baking beans. Blind bake the pastry case in the oven for around 20 minutes until it feels dry to the touch. Remove the parchment/greaseproof paper and beans, brush the pastry with egg white and return to the oven for 5-8 minutes to seal the pastry.\nTo assemble the tart, spoon the cooled pastry cream into the pastry case. Top with raspberries and blackberries. Dissolve the apricot jam into the just boiled water. Using a pastry brush, gently coat the fruit with the glaze, sprinkle with toasted almonds and dust with icing sugar.\nTo serve remove the outer ring of the tin. Easy the base off with a knife and slide onto a plate or cake stand.",

Remove the pan from the heat and remove the vanilla pod.\nWhisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until well blended. Slowly whisk in the hot milk and cream. Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a gentle heat, stirring continuously, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl.\nFor the garnish, heat a medium frying pan and add any remaining melted butter, the reserved sliced apples and blackberries and gently fry for two minutes.\nTo serve, carefully turn the apple and blackberry charlottes. Spoon a little custard onto each of four serving plates, place the charlottes on top and spoon the garnish alongside.",

Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown. Watch them carefully so that they don\u2019t have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool.\nPut the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball \u2013 you may need to use your hands.\nDivide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and roll into small balls. Place the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading.\nPress the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm/\u00bdin thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool.\nStore in an airtight tin and eat within five days.\nFor the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar.\nStir in the lemon juice and heat gently for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest.\nSimmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the pur\u00e9e as possible. Leave the pur\u00e9e to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of pur\u00e9e.\nPut the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl \u2013 the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don\u2019t take it too far.\nWhen the pur\u00e9e is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined.\nSpoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes \u2013 or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don\u2019t over-stir it. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits.",

Repeat until you have used all the batter. Keep the blinis warm until ready to serve.\nFor the smoked salmon p\u00e2t\u00e9, blend the smoked salmon, double cream and cr\u00e8me fraiche in a food processor to a fine pur\u00e9e.\nSeason with salt, pepper and lemon juice then place in a bowl in the fridge until ready to serve.\nFor the beetroot and shallot pickle, put the baby beetroot in a large saucepan of boiling water and cook for 15-20 minutes. Drain and leave to cool slightly. Carefully peel the beetroots and cut in half. Melt the butter in a medium frying pan and add the beetroots. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly golden-brown.\nFor the pickled shallots, heat the white wine vinegar, sugar, salt and peppercorns in a pan over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Put the shallots in a bowl and pour over the hot vinegar mixture. Mix together, coating the shallots. Set aside to pickle for at least an hour, but preferably 24 hours.\nTo serve, put the mackerel skin-side up on a heavy baking tray and use a chef's blow torch to char the skin. Season with salt and pepper.\nPlace the blinis on the plate alongside the mackerel. Place the smoked salmon p\u00e2t\u00e9 on top of the blinis and the pickled beetroot and shallots on the side.

            "instructions": "Put all the pecan nuts for the pastry and the meringue in a food processor and blend until fine. Weigh out 15g/\u00bdoz for the pastry and set aside the remainder.\nFor the pastry, add the flour, salt and butter to the food processor. Tip in the pecan nuts and pulse until the ingredients are combined and resemble breadcrumbs. Add a tablespoon of cold water and pulse again. Keep adding more water a tablespoon at a time until the mixture comes together as a dough.\nTip out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly until smooth. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for 10\u201315 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease a 20cm/8in pie dish.\nFor the filling, lightly beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, sugar, cinnamon, orange zest and juice. Beat until combined. Pour in the evaporated milk and then blend everything together using a handheld blender. Set aside.\nRoll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until 5mm/\u00bcin thick. Line the pie dish with the pastry, taking care to push the pastry into the edges. Leave any excess overhanging and lightly prick the base using a fork (do not go through to the tin). Place on a baking tray.\nCover the pastry with baking paper and fill with ceramic baking beads or uncooked rice. Bake on the middle shelf for 10 minutes or until the pastry is dry. Remove from the oven and trim any excess pastry so that they are no higher than the pie tin.\nPour in the filling so that only 5mm/\u00bcin of the pastry can be seen at the top.\nIncrease the oven temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Bake the pie in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn the oven down to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3 and bake for a further 30 minutes or until the filling is firm (a slight wobble in the centre is fine).\nFor the meringue, put the egg whites in the bowl of a large freestanding mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (you can also use a mixing bowl and a hand mixer, but it is much easier and safer to add the syrup when you have both hands free). Place the sugar and 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz water in a saucepan. Place over a low heat and use a sugar thermometer to measure the temperature of the syrup. When the syrup mixture reaches 100C, begin whisking the egg whites.\nWhen the syrup reaches 116C, remove it from the heat. With the motor running, slowly pour the syrup down the side of the bowl into the mixer, taking care not to touch the whisk as it may splash. Continue to whisk until shiny and stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.\nFold the reserved ground pecans into the meringue using a large metal spoon.\nAfter baking, leave the pie to cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Spoon the meringue onto the pie and use a palette knife to smooth into a dome. Use a chef\u2019s blowtorch to brown the top of the meringue.\nFor the syrup, combine the orange juice and sugar in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Measure the temperature using a sugar thermometer and when it reaches 114C remove it from the heat. To decorate the pie, dip a fork into the caramel and carefully drizzle over the pie in a cross-hatch pattern (melted sugar is very hot \u2013 take care not to burn yourself). Serve the pie warm.",

Add the butter and rub it into the flour using your fingertips until you have a breadcrumb consistency. Add the sugar, dried lavender and lemon zest and mix well. Make a well in the centre and add the milk. Using a round-tipped knife, mix until it starts to form a dough. Gently bring the dough together with your hands.\nTip it out onto a lightly floured surface and form the dough into a mound, but do not knead or the scone will become chewy rather than soft and crumbly. Transfer the dough to the centre of the prepared tray and use a rolling pin or the back of your hand to press the dough out to a large circle about 2cm/1in thick. You can trim the edges if you like, but I prefer not to.\nUse a sharp knife to cut the circle into 12 slices, cutting all the way down and all the way through. Bake for 15 minutes. The scone should be golden around the edges and firm to the touch.\nLeave to cool completely on the tray. As soon as it is cool enough, transfer to your chosen serving dish.\nTo make the topping, mix the clotted cream and vanilla bean paste together. Add the jam and ripple it through with a spoon. Spread the mixture all over the scone, leaving a 1cm/\u00bdin gap around the edge, like a pizza crust, so you\u2019ll have somewhere cream-free to hold. Top with blueberries, scatter with lemon zest and serve.",

Pour the golden syrup into the bottom and scatter in the blueberries.\nWhisk together the remaining pudding ingredients in a bowl until light and fluffy. Carefully spoon the pudding mixture into the pudding dish.\nCover the pudding dish with a large square of baking parchment, then cover that with a large square of aluminium foil. Tie the two sheets tightly into place under the rim of the bowl using cook's string, leaving long ends of excess string to make a handle. Loop one of the excess string lengths over the pudding basin and slide underneath the taut string, holding the sheets in place on the other side. Bring up the string and firmly knot with the other piece of excess string, to form a secure handle to lift the pudding in and out of the water.\nPlace a clean tea towel in the bottom of a large, heavy-based saucepan, then put an upside-down saucer or small plate on top of it. Half-fill the pan with water.\nSit the wrapped pudding dish on top of the saucer, making sure the string handle is easily accessible. Cover the pan with the lid and bring the water to the boil. Reduce the heat until the water is simmering and cook the pudding for 1\u00bd-2 hours.\nMeanwhile, for the custard, bring the milk, cream, vanilla pods and vanilla seeds gently to the boil in a saucepan.\nWhisk the sugar and egg yolks in a bowl until pale and creamy.\nWhen the milk mixture is just about to boil, pour it onto the egg mixture, whisking continuously until all of the liquid has been incorporated.\nReturn the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, whisking all the time, until the custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon.\nStrain the custard into a clean pan and warm through very gently.\nWhen the pudding has cooked, lift it out of the pan using the string handle. Unwrap the pudding and discard the foil and baking parchment. Turn the pudding out onto a serving plate, then cut into wedges and serve with the custard.",

Season the beef really well with salt and pepper.\nHeat two tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan. Fry the beef in three batches over a medium\u2013high heat until nicely browned on all sides, turning every now and then and adding more oil if necessary. As soon as the beef is browned, transfer to a large flameproof casserole. Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3.\nPour a little more oil into the pan in which the beef was browned and fry the bacon for 2\u20133 minutes, or until the fat crisps and browns. Scatter the bacon over the meat. Add a touch more oil to the frying pan and fry the chopped onion over a low heat for 5\u20136 minutes, stirring often until softened. Stir the garlic into the pan and cook for 1 minute more.\nAdd the onion and garlic to the pan with the meat and pour over the wine. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and 150ml/5fl oz water. Crumble over the stock cube, add the herbs and bring to a simmer. Stir well, cover with a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook for 1\u00bd \u20131\u00be hours, or until the beef is almost completely tender.\nWhile the beef is cooking, peel the button onions. Put the onions in a heatproof bowl and cover with just-boiled water. Leave to stand for five minutes and then drain. When the onions are cool enough to handle, trim off the root close to the end so they don\u2019t fall apart and peel off the skin.\nA few minutes before the beef is ready, melt half of the butter in a large non-stick frying pan with a touch of oil and fry the onions over a medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides. Tip into a bowl. Add the remaining butter and mushrooms to the pan and cook for 2\u20133 minutes over a fairly high heat until golden brown, turning often.\nMix the cornflour with the water in a small bowl until smooth.\nRemove the casserole from the oven and stir in the cornflour mixture, followed by the onions and mushrooms. Return to the oven and cook for 45 minutes more, or until the beef is meltingly tender and the sauce is thick. The sauce should coat the back of a spoon \u2013 if it remains fairly thin, simply add a little more cornflour, blended with a little cold water and simmer for a couple of minutes on the hob.\nTo serve, remove the thyme stalks. Sprinkle the casserole with parsley and serve.",

Add the butter, then add the garlic, shallots and peppercorns and fry for one minute.\nAdd the carrots and celery and fry gently for about five minutes until lightly coloured. Remove the bacon collar from the liquid the meat was boiled in.\nCut and lift off the bacon skin with a sharp knife - it should come off in a single piece. Put the skinned bacon joint on top of the vegetables in the casserole.

Using your hands, divide the mixture into large walnut-sized pieces and roll into neat balls in the palms of your hand.\nAdd the rolled dumplings to the casserole, around the joint, and place the casserole back into the oven to cook for a further 25-30 minutes. When done the dumplings should be cooked through, puffed and light. The meat will be tender and unctuous, the vegetables will have collapsed a little and the cooking liquid will have thickened.\nTo serve, carefully lift the meat from the casserole onto a board and cut into generous slices. Divide the vegetables equally among four plates, top with slices of the meat, surround with a few dumplings and spoon over the thickened juices. Serve with English mustard.",

Trim the stalks if they are stringy, and remove the choke (the furry yellow matter in the centre of the artichoke) if there is one. Cut the artichokes into quarters, then place in a bowl and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nCut the boiled lemons in half, then scoop out and discard the soft inner pulp and other stringy pith. Tear the skins of each half into 2-3 pieces and add to the artichokes.\nHeat a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the almonds and toast them, tossing over occasionally, to brown all over.\nAdd the toasted almonds and thyme leaves to the artichoke and lemon mixture.\nMix the honey with the lemon juice in a clean bowl and add the olive oil.

Season with salt and pepper and stir in the basil. Keep warm until ready to serve.\nFor the pasta, cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water until al dente (about 3-4 minutes). Drain, reserving a little pasta water, and add the bolognese. Mix together with a little pasta water.\nTo serve, place some of the pasta and bolognese in serving bowls.

Cover with cling film and set aside for 10 minutes.\nBeat the eggs and add the sugar and vanilla paste. Sieve the flour into a large bowl and add the salt and nutmeg. Make a well in the flour and pour in the milk mixture. Use your hands to bring the dough together - it will be very sticky and wet. Attach a dough hook to a freestanding mixer, add the dough and begin to knead.\nIn a separate bowl beat the cinnamon into the butter until combined, then add to the dough mix as it is being kneaded. When all the butter has been incorporated into the dough, flour the work surface and knead the dough by hand until it is smooth, soft and elastic. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with cling film and refrigerate overnight.\nFor the butterscotch, put a pan over a medium heat. Add the sugar, cream, vanilla, cream of tartar and 75ml/2\u00bdfl oz water. Stir and cook the butterscotch until it reaches 114C (use a sugar thermometer for this), add the butter and keep checking the temperature. When the syrup reaches 143C pour it into the prepared tin and set aside to cool and harden.\nFor the fudge, grease and line a second small tin. In a pan set over a medium heat combine the milk, butter, vanilla, sugar and salt. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Cover with a tightly fitting lid and cook for a further two minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook at a rolling boil for 10 minutes until it reaches 114C (use a sugar thermometer), then transfer the pan to a bowl filled with cold water. Leave the pan in a cool place until it is lukewarm (or 43C) - do not stir. When the fudge has cooled, use a wooden spoon to beat it until it is thick, smooth and creamy. Pour into the prepared tin and set aside in a cool place to harden.\nFor the cream cheese frosting, whisk the butter and cream cheese until smooth and light. Stir in the icing sugar until incorporated, then briefly whisk again until light and smooth (take care not to over whisk the frosting as it will become runny). Set aside until ready to serve.\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and grease and line a small square baking tin. When the butterscotch and fudge have hardened break them into small pieces.\nRemove the dough from the fridge, knead the fudge and butterscotch pieces into the dough, and divide into 12 equally-sized balls.\nGrease a 30cm/12in high-sided round baking tin with butter and dust with sugar. Place the dough balls in neatly and set aside for two hours to rise. When the brioche has risen, mix together the egg yolk and milk and brush over the loaf gently with a pastry brush.\nPut the brioche in the preheated oven for five minutes, then reduce the temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and bake for a further 25 minutes, or until it is golden-brown and sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Transfer to a cooling rack.\nWhen the loaf is cool, remove from the tin and spread the cream cheese icing on the top of each bun. Allow the icing to set a little before serving.",

Partially cut the toffee into even pieces with an oiled knife. When it has cooled completely, break along these lines. Alternatively let the toffee cool completely, then break into shards with a toffee hammer or rolling pin.\nStore in an airtight container, with individual layers of toffee separated by baking parchment.

Butter the inside of a two-litre pudding basin.\nPut the cream and chocolate in a medium non-stick saucepan and heat very gently, stirring regularly until the chocolate melts. Remove from the heat.\nPlace the egg yolks, Irish cream liqueur and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale.\nSlowly pour the warm cream and chocolate mixture onto the eggs, stirring vigorously until thoroughly combined. Carefully pour the mixture into the buttered pudding dish and place in a large roasting tin.\nBoil a kettle of water and carefully pour the just-boiled water into the roasting tin so it rises roughly 3cm/1\u00bcin up the side of the dish. Take care that you don\u2019t drip any water on the cream mixture.\nOpen the oven door, and using an oven-cloth to hold as the tin will be hot, place the pudding in the centre of the oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes. The custard is ready when it is almost set. If you move the dish, you should see the custard wobble like a jelly with a slight ripple under the surface. It will continue to firm up as it cools.\nTake the roasting tin out of the oven, lift the pudding dish carefully from the water and set aside to cool for about an hour. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge overnight.\nUp to five hours before serving, make the caramel. Put the sugar and four tablespoons of cold water into a small saucepan and place over a medium heat for about a minute, stirring with a wooden spoon until the sugar dissolves.\nIncrease the heat a little and cook the sugar, without stirring, for 5-7 minutes, or until it turns golden-brown \u2013 the same colour as maple syrup. Uncover the custard and have close to hand ready for the caramel topping.\nAs soon as the caramel is ready, remove the pan from the heat. Do not touch or taste the caramel as it will be extremely hot. The caramel will continue to cook once it has been removed from the heat, so don\u2019t allow it to become any darker before you take it off.\nBrush a large metal serving spoon with oil and slowly pour the caramel over the spoon onto the cooled custard, ensuring it is covered as evenly as possible. Don\u2019t pour into one area only or the hot caramel will begin to melt the cream. Tilt the dish to help it run to the edges if necessary. Leave to cool for 15 minutes before serving or keep covered in the fridge. (The caramel will begin to soften after a couple of hours.)\nFor the langues de chat biscuits, pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and line two baking trays with parchment paper.\nUsing an electric whisk, cream the butter and icing sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla extract, cinnamon and orange zest. Whisk in the egg whites one at a time and then fold in the flour.\nUsing a piping bag fitted with a plain 1cm/\u00bdin nozzle, pipe 6cm/2\u00bdin strips of the mixture onto the lined baking trays.\nBake for 6-8 minutes until the edges are slightly golden-brown. Leave to cool on the tray.\nServe the caramel-topped Trinity cream with the langue de chat biscuits alongside.",

Alternatively, pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen, then transfer the ice cream to an airtight, freezeable container and freeze until needed.\nMeanwhile, for the doughnut, mix the flour and sugar in a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of a free-standing mixer.\nHeat 100g/3\u00bdoz of the butter and half of the milk in a saucepan over a low heat.

Place one inside the other.\nMelt the remaining 150g/5oz of butter and pour into a large, high-sided roasting tray.\nMix together the demerara sugar and cinnamon in another high-sided roasting tray.\nTurn out the proved dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead it gently for a couple of minutes until smooth and elastic, then roll it into a big bun shape. Using a pair of scissors, snip the dough in the centre to create a hole reaching all the way from the top to the bottom of the bun; use your fingers to gently increase the size of the hole.\nDip the monster doughnut into the melted butter until completely coated, then dust it on all sides with the cinnamon sugar. Transfer the doughnut to the prepared tin, easing the doughnut hole around the smaller cake tin or ramekin. Cover the doughnut loosely with cling film and set aside at room temperature for 40-45 minutes, or until the dough is well risen.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.\nWhen the monster doughnut has proved, remove the cling film and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and cooked through. Carefully remove the inner tin, then turn the whole doughnut out onto a large serving platter.\nStir the icing sugar and bourbon together in a bowl until smooth, then spoon the mixture into a small piping bag and drizzle it over the top of doughnut.\nFill a ramekin small enough to fit inside the doughnut hole with the ice cream.

            "instructions": "To confit the legs, combine the salt, juniper, thyme, garlic and peppercorns in a bowl. Rub the mixture over the legs. Chill in the fridge for 24 hours, turning two or three times.\nWipe the legs with kitchen paper and pat dry, but don\u2019t wash off the marinade. Put into a cast-iron casserole and cover with the duck fat. Heat on the hob to a gentle simmer. Put the lid on and cook for 2-3 hours, until the meat is very tender. Remove from the heat and leave to cool in the fat.\nFor the glaze, heat the brown sugar, bourbon and soy sauce in a pan and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, but not quite a syrup. Stir in the butter and paprika.\nTo cook the turkey crown, preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3. Season the crown with salt and pepper, rub with oil, transfer to a roasting dish and roast for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and brush with the glaze. Continue to brush with glaze periodically for the rest of the cooking time, reserving some of the glaze for the confit legs. Cooking will take about 2 hours in total, but check by piercing the thickest part of the meat with a skewer. When the juices run clear it is cooked. Remove from the oven, cover, and leave to rest.\nWhile the crown is resting, carefully remove the confit legs from the fat. Put them on a baking tray and roast for 20 minutes to crisp. Glaze and baste the confit legs for another 20 minutes, or until golden.\nServe the turkey crown and confit legs in slices with all the trimmings.",

Rub it all over the meat and set aside for 1 hour.\nRinse the ribs well under cold water, gently rubbing off all the salt and pat dry. Put them into a large lidded saucepan. Add the ginger, onion, garlic, star anise, cinnamon and peppercorns. Pour over the stock, rice wine and rice vinegar. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, covered, for 1 hour.\nLift out the ribs and set aside. If you are not serving them in the next couple of hours, let the ribs cool and store them in the fridge, covered, until ready to use. If you do this, make sure you bring them back to room temperature before you coat them in the glaze before serving.\nStrain the liquid, discarding the onion, garlic and spices, and return it to the pan. Place on a high heat and cook for 30-35 minutes, until the liquid has reduced to about 200ml/7fl oz. Remove from the heat and set aside. Chill if you are not serving the ribs in the next 2 hours.\nFor the smoked corn salad, remove the husks from the corn and use them to line the base of a large lidded saucepan or wok which is deep enough to fit a colander or metal steaming basket inside. Add the lemon thyme and place the pan over a high heat. Once the husks and thyme begin to smoke (about 6 minutes) place the colander in the pan and place the corn cobs inside it. Use a lid to seal the pan and smoke for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, for another 5 minutes. Remove the lid and set aside to cool.\nStand each corn cob on a chopping board and use a large sharp knife to shave off rows of kernels, cutting from top to bottom. Cut deep enough into the cob so that some of the kernels remain in clusters, this isn\u2019t essential, it just looks good. Set the corn kernels aside and discard the cobs.\nMake the glaze about 45 minutes before you are ready to serve, place all the ingredients for the glaze, along with 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz of the stock reduction, in a large pan. Bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium-high heat for 20-25 minutes, until the liquid has reduced to about 200ml/7fl oz and has the consistency of syrup. Return the pork ribs to the sauce and stir gently so they all get coated. Cook for about 7 more minutes on a medium heat, stirring once or twice until the ribs are warmed through and sticky.\nJust before serving, finish the salad by placing the lime juice, maple syrup, olive oil and chilli in a large bowl with 1 teaspoon sea salt. Whisk to combine, then mix in the corn kernels, herbs and spring onion. Place two small racks of ribs on each plate \u2013 one leaning against the other \u2013 and serve with the corn salad alongside.",

Remove from the pan and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.\nAdd spoonfuls of the boxty batter into the same oil that the bacon was cooked in, leaving enough space around each spoonful for the mixture to spread. Fry the boxties on a medium to high heat for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the boxties are golden-brown and the grated potato is cooked through. Remove the boxties from the pan using a slotted spoon, set aside to drain on kitchen paper and keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining boxty mixture.\nTo serve, divide the boxties equally among four to six serving plates. Place a rasher or two of crisp streaky bacon alongside each.

Reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.\nDrain and return to the pan, then place over a low heat for a couple of minutes to dry the potatoes slightly.\nMeanwhile, put the butter and milk into a saucepan and simmer until the butter is melted.\nPass the potatoes through a ricer, then add the hot butter and milk (or cream) and beat to form a very smooth mash. Season, to taste, with salt and black pepper.\nTo serve, lift out the beef cheeks and place in shallow bowls. Spoon the mash alongside and finish with a generous ladleful of sauce.",

Remove the beef from the dish and shred into small strips. Place in a bowl with a little cooking liquor and set aside.\nPut the flour, three eggs and olive oil in a food processor and pulse until it forms small crumbs. Tip the mixture onto a lightly floured work surface and bring together to form a dough. Knead lightly for 2-3 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Roll into a ball, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nLightly flour your pasta machine to prevent the dough from sticking. Take the dough ball from the fridge, and flatten it slightly with a rolling pin, then starting at the lowest (thickest) setting, feed the dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand and holding the dough as it comes through the machine with the other.\nChange the setting on the pasta machine to the next-thickest setting, flour it again and feed the pasta sheet through the machine again, as before. Repeat this process, flouring the machine and changing the setting down each time, until you reach the thinnest setting. You can cut the pasta into smaller individual sheets and work on them individually, keeping the remaining unused dough covered under cling film to prevent it drying out.\nBeat the remaining egg in a bowl. Cut out circles from the pasta sheets using a 6cm/2\u00bdin pastry cutter, then brush each circle with the beaten egg. Place a heaped teaspoon of the beef filling onto one half of the circle, then fold over the other half and press together to seal. Bring the two corners together to create a ring and pinch to seal. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling mixture, placing the completed tortellini on a tray lined with greaseproof paper. Cover with cling film until ready to cook.\nFor the mushroom sauce, heat the butter in a large frying pan until foaming. Add the garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and the liquid from the mushrooms has been released. Pour in the Madeira and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock and reduce again by half. Stir in the cream and tarragon and simmer for 5-7 minutes.\nTo cook the tortellini, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the tortellini and cook for 1-2 minutes or until they float to the surface then remove with a slotted spoon and drain.\nPlace the tortellini in a serving bowl and pour over the sauce.

Return the beef to the pan and put it back in the oven for a further 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the parsnip pur\u00e9e. Place the parsnips and shallots into a saucepan with the milk, cream and bay leaves and cover with water. Add the olive oil and lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. Drain the vegetables, reserving the cooking liquid, and discard the bay leaves. Place the vegetables in a food processor and blend with enough cooking liquid to make a pur\u00e9e with the consistency of whipped cream.

Cook until syrup-like in consistency and reduced in volume by three-quarters.\nReturn the beef ribs to the pan, cover with the beef stock and bring to the boil. Cut out a greaseproof paper lid the size of the pan. Skim off any impurities from the surface of the liquid with a spoon, cover with the greaseproof paper lid, turn the heat down low and simmer for three hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.\nWhen the beef is cooked, strain the liquid, pouring the sauce into a clean saucepan. Set the cooked meat aside.\nPlace the liquid onto the heat, bring to the boil and then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer. Continue to simmer until reduced by half, skimming off any excess fat with a spoon.\nMeanwhile, pick the meat from the bones, discarding any fat and sinew. Remove the reduced sauce from the heat and add the picked meat to it. Mix well.\nHeat a frying pan until hot, add the remaining vegetable oil to the pan and the sliced onion. Fry for 5-8 minutes until golden-brown and softened. Stir in the thyme leaves and set aside.\nFor the mash, place the potato pieces into a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until tender. Drain and return the potatoes to the pan to drive off any excess moisture.\nPass the potatoes through a ricer into a clean bowl (alternatively use a potato masher, though you will not get such as smooth finish).\nBring the milk and butter to a simmer in a separate pan. Add the hot milk and butter mixture to the potatoes and beat well. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and tip the mixture into a piping bag.\nTo finish the beef, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Spoon the braised beef into 4-6 ovenproof dishes and top with the fried onions. Place a marrow bone in the centre of each dish and place the rosemary sprigs in the top of the bone. Pipe the mashed potato onto the meat.\nCook in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden and bubbling.\nServe the braised short rib and onion cottage pie at once.",

Bring to the boil, then simmer for about five minutes, or until the berries break down. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.\nTip the fruit mixture into a blender and blend to a pur\u00e9e, then strain through a sieve, rubbing it through with the back of a spoon. Set aside until ready to serve.\nFor the apple pur\u00e9e, put all the ingredients into a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring occasionally until the apples break down. Allow to cool slightly and then blend to a smooth pur\u00e9e, either using a hand-blender, or by tipping the mixture into a food processor or blender. Store any leftovers from this recipe in the fridge and use as sauce for roast pork or serve with yoghurt for breakfast.\nFor the souffl\u00e9, butter four individual 10cm/4in souffl\u00e9 dishes using upward strokes to encourage the souffl\u00e9 mixture to rise. Coat the insides with 40g of the sugar.\nHeat the milk and 20g/\u00beoz of the sugar in a small pan. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla pod and bring slowly to the boil, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat.\nWhisk the egg yolks and 15g/\u00bdoz of the sugar in a bowl to a ribbon consistency. (Ribbon consistency is when the egg yolks and sugar have thickened and increased in volume to a point where a trail of the mixture holds on the surface for a second before merging back in.) Stir in the flour. Pour the hot milk onto the yolks, stirring continuously with a whisk. Return to the pan and whisk over a low heat for one minute, then pour into a bowl, cover with cling film, and cool slightly. Stir in two tablespoons of the apple pur\u00e9e once cool.\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a baking tray inside to heat.\nEnsure that your whisking equipment is clean and free from grease - otherwise it may prevent the egg whites from rising. Beat the egg whites in a mixing bowl until thick and frothy, then add the remaining sugar and continue to beat until the egg whites form soft peaks when the whisk is removed from the bowl. It is crucial not to over-beat the egg whites. Immediately and confidently whisk one-third of the egg whites into the apple mixture, then delicately fold in the rest with a large spoon.\nDivide the mixture between the souffl\u00e9 dishes to come level with the rim, burying the biscuits (if using) in the middle. Stand on the hot baking tray and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until risen a 2.5cm/1cm over the top of the dish and the top is golden-brown. Overcooking will cause the souffl\u00e9s to collapse. Serve the souffl\u00e9s as soon as they come out of the oven on warm plates. Make a well in the middle of the souffl\u00e9 and pour in the coulis.",

            "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line two baking trays with baking parchment then oil a thickish handle of a wooden spoon and lay it on a cooling rack.\nMeasure the butter, sugar and syrup into a small, heavy-based pan. The easiest way is to measure the butter, then the sugar on the scales (in the pan if you have digital scales), then measure the syrup on top to make up to 165g/6oz total weight.\nHeat gently until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. This will take about 15 minutes over a low heat. Don\u2019t let the mixture boil as it may crystallise. To check when the sugar has dissolved, stir occasionally, pulling the spoon across the bottom of the pan until you can no longer hear the gritty granules being scraped along and most of them have disappeared.\nLeave the mixture to cool slightly, about 2-3 minutes, then sieve in the flour and ginger. Pour in the lemon juice and stir well to mix thoroughly. Drop four teaspoonfuls of the mixture onto each of the prepared baking trays to make neat circles, about 10cm/4in apart.\nBake in the pre-heated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture is well spread out, looks lacey and is a dark golden colour. Once baked, you need to work fast to shape the brandy snaps, so its easier if you bake one tray at a time. Remove each tray from the oven and leave for a minute or so to firm up slightly, then lift from the baking parchment using a fish slice. The mixture needs to be just firm enough to remove, but pliable enough to shape. Check by releasing around and under the edges with a small palette knife.\nQuickly roll a circle of the warm mixture around the handle of the wooden spoon, having the join underneath. Press the join lightly together to seal, then slide the brandy snap off the spoon and leave it to firm up on the wire rack, again with the join underneath. If any of the circles on the sheet harden too much to work with, put them back in the oven for a few seconds to soften again. Repeat until all the mixture has been used. If the mixture in the pan becomes too firm to drop in neat spoonfuls, roll a teaspoonful of it into a small smooth ball in your hands, sit it on the baking tray and flatten slightly with your fingers. When cold, store the brandy snaps in an airtight tin or container; they will keep for at least a week.",

While the brandy snaps are cooking, grease two wooden spoons with butter and wrap an elastic band around them to bind them together. Place four more scant tablespoons of the brandy snap mixture on the second baking tray.\nTake the brandy snaps out of the oven and put the second tray in to bake for the same amount of time. Let the brandy snaps rest for 30-60 seconds, then carefully lift one off with a palette knife and wrap around the spoons, overlapping it a little. Hold for around 30 seconds until the biscuit sets in a tube shape, then gently slide off the spoons and put on a rack to cool. Repeat the method with the remaining brandy snaps. If the biscuits become too hard to roll at any stage, simply return to the oven for a few seconds to soften them. Continue baking and rolling the brandy snaps until all the mixture is used.\nTo prepare the filling, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Stir in the chopped ginger and spoon into a large piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle. Pipe the ginger cream into each end of the brandy snaps and place them fairly close together on a rack placed over a board.\nMelt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, taking care the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water.
